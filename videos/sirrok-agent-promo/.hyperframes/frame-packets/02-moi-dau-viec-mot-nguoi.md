## Frame 2 — Mỗi đầu việc một người

- type: pain_point
- duration: 6.9s
- transition_in: crossfade
- status: built
- src: compositions/frames/02-moi-dau-viec-mot-nguoi.html
- blueprint: overwhelm-surround (Reproduce)
- focal: overwhelm-surround (component) — khớp đúng blueprint, không dựng lại
- roles: 4 thẻ có chữ = cutout · 8 thẻ mờ = supporting · glyph bạn ở tâm = cutout (chủ thể bị vây)
- persuasion: Pain agitation
- beat: bị vây bởi chính bảng lương của mình
- scene: Thẻ vai trò dồn vào từ bốn phía rồi vây kín giữa khung
- vo_file: public/audio/vo-02.mp3 (6.55s, ElevenLabs Daniel)
- voiceover: "Content. Quảng cáo. Báo cáo. Support. Mỗi đầu việc một người."
- sfx: layered paper whoosh, rising density
- asset_candidates: "agent-row / card-tinted thẻ vai trò (tự dựng), tag-pill mức lương"
- narrative_role: "Agitate the cost — biến con số 20–30 thành cảm giác bị vây"
- handoff_in: "dome mark — center (960, 540), scale 1.0, opacity 1 → thu về scale 0.35 và mờ dần về 0 trong 0.5s đầu khi thẻ đầu tiên vào"

Reproduce: lấy nguyên signature move **elements close in from all sides** — vây,
không zoom. Chủ thể ở tâm là glyph người (chính người xem), giữ tĩnh trong khi
mọi thứ quanh nó siết lại.

Scene 1 (0.0–0.5s): dome mark của frame trước co về scale 0.35 và mờ về 0; glyph người `text` đậm xuất hiện dead-center kèm chip "bạn". Centered, khung còn trống hết.
Scene 2 (0.5–3.0s): bốn thẻ vai trò có chữ bay vào **từ bốn rìa khung**, một thẻ cho mỗi tên được đọc — Content (trái trên), Quảng cáo (phải trên), Báo cáo (trái dưới), Support (phải dưới); mỗi thẻ **spring-pop entrance** settle long-tail, pill mức lương pop sau thân thẻ 0.12s. Rule-of-thirds bốn góc, 3 lớp.
Scene 3 (3.0–4.6s): trên "Mỗi đầu việc một người", tám thẻ mờ (chỉ còn pill lương, không chữ) **cascade vào theo stagger** lấp các khe còn lại — mật độ dâng, không thẻ nào che glyph ở tâm. Density đạt ~70% khung.
Scene 4 (4.6–6.9s): **signature move** — cả cụm 12 thẻ siết vào tâm từ mọi phía cùng lúc, khoảng trống quanh glyph người thu hẹp dần; `depth-of-field-blur` làm mờ nhẹ lớp thẻ ngoài rìa để glyph ở tâm vẫn là focal. Dừng ở trạng thái **chật nhất** và đóng băng 0.4s cuối — không giải quyết gì, đó là mục đích.

## Selected blueprint: overwhelm-surround

# overwhelm-surround — Overwhelm / Close-In

**intent**: Convey overwhelm by accumulation. Recognizable subjects assemble, density markers scatter in to amplify "look how much," then the central subject morphs into the viewer's own avatar and elements close in from ALL sides — the frame feels surrounded, not zoomed-into. The emotional arc is recognition → claustrophobia.

**roles served**

- Problem (from `problem-mockup-overwhelm`): when the problem beat must first show "too many tools / too much surface area" and then put **the viewer inside it** — a literal swap of subject (product → person) followed by a closing-in that feels invasive. Reach for it when the pain is "you're buried," not "this metric is bad" (that's `dataviz-countup`).
- Problem (from `desktop-clutter-accumulation`): when the overwhelm is a **workspace**, not a tool
  count — live windows, stickies, and alert toasts pile up until the frame is chaotically full, and
  the beat resolves not by closing in but by shoving the clutter aside and asking the question.
  Reach for this variant when the pain lands on words ("how can you X… when you spend months on
  Y?"), not on a surrounded avatar.

**duration**: 6–9s (clutter-shove-to-question variant ~10s)

**shot structure** (a `[bg]` canvas; recognizable surfaces first, the viewer's avatar revealed underneath, then a radial crowd)

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~1.6s) — recognizable assembly.** Three `[product mockups / surfaces]` assemble into something the viewer knows — staggered scale-in, the **center** one full-size, the two flanks smaller (~0.86). Each rides a low-amplitude float so they feel like live context, not a static collage. Camera static.
- **Scene 2 (~1.6–3.0s) — density amplifies.** `[platform icons / logos]` scatter in around the mockups (staggered), used purely as **density markers** — "look how much surface area," not animated dials.
- **Scene 3 (~3.0–4.6s) — the morph (signature move).** The CENTER mockup MORPHS: its content fades out, the container reshapes, and the viewer's `[avatar]` is revealed **underneath** — a literal swap of subject, product → person.
- **Scene 4 (~4.6–end) — close-in.** `[task bubbles / demands]` close in from ALL sides toward the avatar (radial staggered entry). The avatar **stays put** while the bubbles invade — the claustrophobia comes from being surrounded, never from a camera push. Holds on the crowded state.
- **Variant — clutter-shove-to-question** (replaces Scenes 3–4 and
  inverts the camera contract — see modifier): accumulation runs under a **slow steady zoom-out** —
  `[sticky notes]` bounce in springy, `[dashboard / editor windows]` pop and slide up, a stack of
  `[alert toasts]` slides in at one edge, inner content keeps typing / log-scrolling as live density,
  windows overlap until the frame is chaotically full. The camera then REVERSES into a quick
  push-in that **shoves the clutter to the frame edges**, opening central negative space where a
  `[two-part serif question]` builds word-by-word (line 1 swaps in place to line 2); a `[cursor]`
  glides in from off-frame and comes to rest under the text; a very slow forward creep and hold.
  No morph, no avatar — the question is the payoff.

**motion vocabulary**: staggered scale-in assembly; resting-scale-preserving low float; density-marker icon scatter; content-fade → container-reshape → reveal-anchor-beneath morph; radial close-in entry from all compass points; held crowded end-state. Clutter-shove variant: slow steady zoom-out under accumulation; reverse quick push-in; clutter
shoved to frame edges opening center negative space; continuous live typing / log scroll inside
windows as ambient density; toast-stack slide-in; word-by-word serif build with in-place line swap;
cursor glide-to-rest; very slow forward creep + hold.

**rule mapping**

- staggered mockup + icon entries (smooth settle onto their resting scale) → `spring-pop-entrance` (smooth-settle register) backed by `gsap-effects`
- platform icons as density markers (positions pre-baked, scale/opacity only — NOT internal-parts animation) → `svg-icon-enrichment` (its DOM contract only)
- center mockup → avatar morph (HF forbids `width`/`height` tweens → drive the reshape on `scaleX`/`scaleY`, anchor = the avatar layer rendered beneath) → `card-morph-anchor`
- radial bubble close-in (positions baked once via `cos`/`sin`, staggered entry) → `gsap-effects` (radial layout) + `spring-pop-entrance` (per-bubble arrival)
- low-amplitude float on background mockups/icons → `sine-wave-loop` (low-amplitude register — subtle jitter that composes onto each element's resting scale, never a `fromTo` yoyo that re-tweens to its start)
- (variant) zoom-out under accumulation → quick push-in → slow forward creep → `multi-phase-camera`
  (pull-back / push / drift as sequential phases on one world wrapper; counter-translate math in
  `viewport-change`)
- (variant) clutter shoved to the edges as the push-in lands → `center-outward-expansion` (outward
  vectors to edge resting positions), fired at the same timeline position as the camera push so the
  shove reads as CAUSED by it (`reactive-displacement` register)
- (variant) word-by-word serif question build → `gsap-effects` (staggered word reveal); the
  in-place line-1 → line-2 swap → `discrete-text-sequence`
- (variant) live typing inside windows → `gsap-effects` (typewriter); the continuous inner
  log-scroll — composition: looping content translateY via `gsap-effects` (masked)
- (variant) cursor glide-in coming to rest → `cursor-click-ripple` (approach portion only — no click)

**camera modifier**: camera-static — the close-in must read as the world crowding the subject, so the frame holds; a push-in would convert "surrounded" into "zoomed-into" and kill the claustrophobia. The clutter-shove-to-question variant is the sanctioned exception: there the camera IS the
storyteller (zoom-out ↔ push-in via `multi-phase-camera`), and the claustrophobia comes from
accumulation, not surround — never mix the two resolutions in one shot.

# Depth-of-Field Blur (Selective Focus / Rack Focus)

Pulls the eye to one focal element by **blurring** (and slightly **dimming**) everything around it while the focal layer stays sharp — the camera's depth-of-field falling off the background, or a rack-focus shifting which plane is in focus. `filter` and `opacity` are paint-only, so both tween seek-safe. This is the backing rule for the focus-falloff beat the blueprints reach for: outer nodes blurring during a push-in (`constellation-hub`), rack-focus across a parallax card stack (`cursor-ui-demo`), non-highlighted cards dimming to spotlight a hero metric (`dataviz-countup`).

## How It Works

Every layer carries a `--dof` custom property (px of blur), read by `filter: blur(var(--dof))`, plus its own `opacity`. A GSAP tween advances each layer's `--dof` from `0` to its target blur and its opacity from `1` to a dim level over the focus-shift window. The focal layer's `--dof` stays `0`. Per-layer targets derive from `data-depth` / index, so the falloff is identical on every seek.

Three mechanics, same primitive:

1. **Focal pull** — one window: off-focus layers go sharp(0) → blurred while the focal layer holds at 0. The eye is pulled to the only thing still crisp.
2. **Rack focus** — two adjacent windows on the same property: plane A's blur ramps 0 → max at the same position plane B's ramps max → 0. State continuity matters exactly as in `press-release-spring`: A's resting blur after the rack must equal what B held before it — author both as tweens on the same `--dof` at the same position so the hand-off is seamless.
3. **Blur-the-cluster-while-pushing-in** — the DoF tween runs at the SAME timeline position as a camera push-in (`multi-phase-camera` / `coordinate-target-zoom`): "the world recedes" and "we push in" read as one move.

## Recipe

```html
<div class="world" id="world">
  <!-- Focal layer — stays sharp -->
  <div class="layer focal" id="focal">{FocalLabel}</div>
  <!-- Off-focus layers — blur + dim; data-depth orders near→far -->
  <div class="layer ctx" data-depth="1">{Context A}</div>
  <div class="layer ctx" data-depth="2">{Context B}</div>
  <div class="layer ctx" data-depth="3">{Context C}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.world {
  /* single wrapper so a concurrent camera push-in transforms everything
     together; DoF is independent of the camera */
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  transform-origin: 50% 50%;
}
.layer {
  --dof: 0px; /* px of blur; filter reads it — starts sharp */
  filter: blur(var(--dof));
  will-change: filter; /* promotes the layer so per-frame re-rasterization is cheap */
}
.focal {
  z-index: 2; /* sharp layer must sit ABOVE the blurred ones, or its crisp
     edges read as bleeding into the haze */
}
.ctx {
  z-index: 1;
}
```

```js
// Mechanic 1 — FOCAL PULL. Blur scales with data-depth so far planes blur
// more than near ones; the focal layer (--dof: 0, opacity: 1) is untouched.
gsap.utils.toArray(".ctx").forEach((el) => {
  const depth = Number(el.dataset.depth) || 1;
  tl.to(
    el,
    {
      "--dof": `${BLUR_PER_DEPTH * depth}px`,
      opacity: DIM_LEVEL, // dim, not gone
      duration: FOCUS_DUR,
      ease: "power2.inOut",
    },
    FOCUS_START,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Rack focus between two depth planes** — `gsap.set` plane B pre-blurred BEFORE the rack (no pop), then two tweens sharing `RACK_START` + `RACK_DUR`: A → `MAX_BLUR` + `DIM_LEVEL`, B → `0px` + `1`. Shared window makes them cross at the midpoint.
- **Blur the cluster while pushing in** — run the focal-pull tweens at the same position + duration as a camera tween on `#world` (`scale/x/y`, `power2.inOut`). Camera transforms the world; DoF tweens the layers — independent property channels, no conflict.
- **Spotlight a hero metric in a card grid** — `gsap.utils.toArray(".card:not(.hero)")` all defocus (`GRID_BLUR` + `DIM_LEVEL`) on one shared window; heroes are skipped.
- **Refocus / settle** — if the beat resolves back to "everything visible" (or hands off to a crossfade needing a clean outgoing frame), ramp all `--dof` back to `0px` / opacity 1 over the tail (`REFOCUS_START + REFOCUS_DUR ≤ DURATION`).
- **Bounded focus-breathing on the focal layer (optional)** — a finite `ease:"none"` driver writes `Math.max(0, Math.sin(p)) * FOCAL_BREATH_PX` into the focal `--dof` during a hold. Keep it ≤ ~0.6px or it reads as "still focusing"; default to omitting it.

## Values

| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BLUR_PER_DEPTH        | 3–6 px per depth step                  | a 3-plane stack tops out ~9–18 px; low = gentle DoF, high = tilt-shift falloff                           |
| MAX_BLUR              | 8 soft → 16 default → 24 heavy px      | terminal blur for a fully-defocused plane; above ~24 px on a big surface, shrink/group the layer instead |
| GRID_BLUR             | 6–12 px                                | pushes cards back without losing the grid's shape                                                        |
| DIM_LEVEL             | 0.4 strong → 0.55 default → 0.7 subtle | rarely below 0.35 — fully dark reads as "removed," not "defocused"                                       |
| FOCUS_DUR             | 0.5–1.2 s                              | a rack/pull is a deliberate move, not a snap; shorter = snap focus, longer = languid                     |
| RACK_START / RACK_DUR | shared by both planes                  | `gsap.set` the pre-blurred plane BEFORE `RACK_START`                                                     |
| FOCAL_BREATH_PX       | ≤ 0.6 px, period 2–3 s                 | barely-there nicety                                                                                      |
| FOCAL vs CTX sizing   | context smaller / grouped              | small context layers let a modest radius still read as "out of focus" — and blur cheaply                 |

Tokens: dark `{bgGradient}` so the sharp focal layer reads as lit and forward; heavy display `{font}` weight — blurred copy needs it to stay shape-legible.

## Critical Constraints

- **Tween the `--dof` variable on the timeline** — reading `filter: blur(var(--dof))` keeps the blur on the HF seek clock.
- **Blur the SMALL / GROUPED layers, not the giant one.** Filter cost scales with radius × pixel area; a 20 px blur on a full-frame background is the worst case. Keep per-layer radius ≤ ~24 px on large surfaces and lean on the `opacity` **dim** to do the push-back work — dim + modest blur reads more like real DoF than blur cranked to the max.
- **`will-change: filter`** on every layer whose blur animates (drop it after settle if the layer also does heavy transform work).
- **Focal layer stays genuinely sharp** — `--dof: 0`, untouched (or breathing ≤ 0.6 px). Any visible blur on the focal element kills the "this is the thing" read.
- **State continuity on a rack** — the outgoing plane starts at the blur the incoming plane was holding, and vice-versa; adjacent tweens on the same `--dof` at the same position.
- **DoF is independent of the camera** — blur the layers, transform `.world` for the push-in; don't fake DoF with the camera transform or vice-versa.
- **Settle sharp before a hand-off** — refocus to `--dof: 0` in the tail if the next beat is a crossfade/push; handing off mid-defocus reads as "the render glitched."
- **Sharp focal layer above blurred layers** (`z-index`).

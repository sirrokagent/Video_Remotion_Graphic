Adapt: giữ signature move **the receipt cascades in and rows CHECK OFF** của
agent-progress-theater. Nhưng trigger beat **không phải** click menu hay modal —
trigger là **giọng nói**, hiện thành dạng sóng. Đó là thứ phải bán được ở frame
này. Surface dùng `browser-device-stage`, 4 dòng dùng `mk-specs-list`, dấu tick
dùng `success-check`. Dạng sóng tự dựng: search audio waveform bars chỉ ra
oscilloscope CRT và bar-chart, không cái nào đúng.

Scene 1 (0.0–0.7s): dome mark bay từ tâm Frame 04 về ô avatar sidebar (330, 300) scale 0.22 bằng **zoom-to-target** nghịch; khung cửa sổ macOS **svg self-draw** vẽ viền ra quanh nó. Asymmetric 70/30 (main · sidebar), 3 lớp.
Scene 2 (0.7–2.0s): trên "Bạn nói", **dạng sóng 24 thanh bật sáng** — chiều cao lấy từ **mảng envelope cố định** (không Math.random, render phải giống hệt mỗi lần), `asr-keyword-glow` chạy dọc dãy thanh theo nhịp từ. Hero của nửa đầu, chiếm ~40% pane chính.
Scene 3 (2.0–3.1s): "Nó nghe," — 4 agent row trong sidebar sáng lên lần lượt, row Sirrok đậm trước rồi tới Content · Ads · Support.
Scene 4 (3.1–4.2s): "nó chia việc," — 4 dòng tác vụ **cascade vào theo stagger** trong pane chính, tất cả còn chưa tick, mỗi dòng mang một chip trạng thái. Focal chuyển từ sóng sang checklist; sóng hạ biên độ nhưng không tắt.
Scene 5 (4.2–6.0s): "rồi nó làm xong" — dòng 1 và 2 **tick** bằng `svg-path-draw` trong vòng `positive`, chữ dòng đã xong chuyển `text-light`; dòng 3 hiện progress đang chạy.
Scene 6 (6.0–8.2s): "và trả lại kết quả." — dòng 3 tick, dòng 4 giữ trạng thái chờ ở opacity 0.42 (trung thực: agent đang chạy, chưa xong hết); sóng settle về idle biên độ thấp. **Held read** 0.3s cuối.

## Selected blueprint: agent-progress-theater

# agent-progress-theater — Agent Progress Theater

**intent**: Agent work performed as WORKING-STATE theater — a short trigger beat hands the frame to the machine, which then visibly _works_: loaders spin, status phrases swap, dots pulse, counters tick — before the receipt arrives as a card whose rows cascade in and CHANGE STATE (badges flip to checks, labels strike through, severity pills read out), or as a conversation thread building message-by-message onto a camera push-in payoff. The subject is the machine performing labor over time. It is NOT a typed prompt awaiting output (no prompt/input is ever typed — the trigger is a click, a menu choice, or an already-running scan); NOT `cursor-ui-demo` (at most ONE igniting click here, then the cursor exits and the UI performs itself); NOT `grid-card-assemble` (rows there assemble into a static enumeration and hold — rows here are alive: they arrive as agent output and then MUTATE, checking off one by one while the viewer watches).

**roles served**

- Key_Feature (from `agent-progress-theater`): when the feature is the agent doing multi-step work (build a plan / scan a repo / fix a vulnerability / handle infra for you) and the proof is status theater — a loader lockup with a typed label, status couplets swapping under an `[accent]` spinner, then a checklist/findings card that populates and checks off in front of the viewer.
- Key_Feature (from `message-thread-payoff`): when the agent's work lives inside a conversation or automation thread — user/agent bubbles and tool-call/reply cards popping in sequence, the working state carried by pulsing loading dots or rapidly ticking diff counters, resolved by ONE camera push-in tight on the confirmation line (`[reaction pill]`, "Sent using `[@Bot]`", a thank-you bubble).

**duration**: 4.2–11.6s (short members are a single card-and-check-off or thread beat at ~4–5s; long members chain trigger → interstitial → status swaps → receipt card at ~9–12s; thread payoff spans 4.2–9.1s)

**shot structure** (a warm flat canvas — `[off-white / warm beige / near-white bg]`, optional `[faint grid / dot-grid / wavy-line]` texture; white rounded cards with soft drop shadows; ONE `[working accent]` color reserved for the machine (spinner, status words, active step) and one `[done color]` for completion (checks, "Completed"); camera static or ONE slow move — motion is overwhelmingly element-level springs, staggers, and state flips. Two folded sub-shapes — **(A) checklist/findings theater** and **(B) message-thread payoff**.)

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~1.5s) — the trigger.** Something asks the machine to work, in ONE beat:
  - _Variant — option menu (A)_: a centered white pill card poses `[the question]`; it SPRINGS open downward into a rounded menu — `[3–4 option rows]` fade/slide in staggered, each with a number badge. A cursor enters, hover-dances between rows (a pale `[hover fill]` highlight follows it), and CLICKS the chosen row (~press-down spring); the whole menu scales down toward its center and fades out. This is the only cursor appearance in the shot.
  - _Variant — modal click (A)_: close-up of a white modal with `[Dismiss]` / `[action button]`; a hand cursor clicks the action (quick press-down spring); the modal fades away. Optionally followed by a serif `[interstitial line]` on the bare canvas — words land staggered, hold, fade out word-staggered as the bg swaps.
  - _Variant — already working (A)_: a `[Scan in progress]`-style state — a thin `[accent]` arc spinner rotating over a heading + body copy + a `[Starting…]` pill (cursor resting on it, motionless); only the spinner moves. The whole scene then rapidly scales up and fades — a push-through exit.
  - _Variant — workspace push-through (A)_: a rapid camera push-in THROUGH a multi-panel `[workspace: builder / editor / terminal]` — panels scale past the viewport edges and clear away to the bare canvas.
  - _Variant — thread opener (B)_: a `[user bubble]` spring-pops in ("`[the ask]`"), OR a stats card pops in whose green/red `[diff counters]` rapidly tick and settle — the automation's opening receipt.

- **Scene 2 (~1–4s) — the working state (the machine performs).** The frame belongs to the machine; nothing is clickable. Pick 1–3 working motifs and CHAIN them:
  - A loader lockup: a spinning `[accent asterisk / arc]` beside a `[working label]` typed on rapidly ("`Buildi` → `Building plan…`"), a left→right shimmer sweep passing through the letters; the spinner may momentarily morph asterisk↔dot and back.
  - Status couplets: 2–3 centered pairs — a dark `[action line]` over an `[accent status word]` ("Thinking…", "Noodling…") with its spinner — swapping via quick fades/slides at a steady cadence.
  - A `[scan/tool label]` types/expands rightward to its full string, then SHRINKS and DOCKS to the top-left as a fixed corner header (the canvas now belongs to what it produces).
  - A status heading flips tense as rows land beneath it ("Using `[Tool]`" → "Used `[Tool]`"), with a gently pulsing "Thinking" and gray meta-lines ("Exploring `[N]` files…") fading in below.
  - _Variant — thread machinery (B)_: the `[agent reply]` fades/slides up, then a monospace `[tool_call]` line appears beneath it — small icon + `[tool name]` + three pulsing loading dots; OR an instruction bubble scrolls into view (internal window scroll, frame static) followed by a `[brand logo]` pop-in beside a "Sending message…" row. **The pulse dies the instant the result lands** — dots vanish as the payload arrives.

- **Scene 3 (~2–4s) — the receipt cascades in (the payoff engine).** The work materializes as a card that BUILDS:
  - _Variant — checklist (A)_: a white `[Progress / summary]` pill or card SPRING-pops in with a bounce, then springs open downward (or the summary card glides UP as a taller `[findings]` panel expands beneath it). Rows cascade in one by one — slide-up + fade, staggered — each with `[number badge / severity pill]` + `[label]` + optional gray `[meta line]`. Then the STATE MUTATION runs: badges flip one by one from numbered outline to a solid `[done color]` circle + white checkmark (slight scale bounce), the checked label simultaneously strikes through and dims; pending items keep partially-drawn arc outlines animating. End the run mid-list — some items checked, some still numbered — the work is visibly _ongoing_.
  - _Variant — thread payload (B)_: the camera pushes in / pans down centering the `[tool_call]` line as a white payload card expands downward from it — 2–4 light monospace `[key: value]` lines fading in. Then the `[resolution message]` expands into place below (inline `[code chips]` and `[link]` coloring), OR a dark `[thread card]` scales up from a status row to DOMINATE the frame while the background darkens, its `[reply]` expanding into place under a "1 reply" divider.

- **Scene 4 (final ~1–2.5s) — resolve.** Two endings:
  - _Variant — hold / scroll (A)_: the finished (or mid-mutation) card stack holds static to the end, OR the viewport scrolls down the final card (fast in the last beat) revealing `[a second heading + numbered list]`, ending mid-list. A slow continuous zoom into the card may run underneath (the header drifts off the top of frame).
  - _Variant — payoff push-in (B)_: ONE camera push-in + pan-down lands tight on the payoff line — "`Sent using [@Bot]`" / the confirmation + `[thank-you bubble]` spring-in — then a `[reaction button]` springs into an active pill with bouncy overshoot and a count. The push eases into a gentle near-imperceptible drift and the clip ends on the close-up. No end card.

**rule mapping**

- pill springs open downward into a menu / panel expands beneath a gliding card / payload card expands downward from a tool-call line → `anchored-layout-expand` (edge-anchored container growth: height-masked wrapper + inner counter-translate, container drawn at final size); spring flavor from `spring-pop-entrance`
- option rows / findings rows / task rows stagger in (slide-up + fade) → `spring-pop-entrance` (staggered-group form, ≤500ms cap) or `gsap-effects` (plain fade+translate stagger) — NOT `waterfall-entry` (its binary no-fade arrival law contradicts this dialect's soft fade/slide cascade)
- cursor glides to a row and clicks; hand cursor clicks the modal button → `cursor-click-ripple` (move + press) + `press-release-spring` (the button's press-down spring)
- pale hover-highlight fill following the cursor between rows → `gsap-effects` (a background fill translated row-to-row; no dedicated rule needed)
- menu scale-down fade exit / scene scale-up push-through exit / palette-for-window swap → `scale-swap-transition`
- thin arc spinner rotation / spinning asterisk loader → `svg-icon-enrichment` (rotating internal SVG parts via `setAttribute('transform','rotate(deg cx cy)')`; timeline-driven, finite)
- asterisk↔dot morph and back → `scale-swap-transition` (two elements morphing at the same center)
- typed-on loader label ("Building plan…") / scan label typing to its full string → `discrete-text-sequence` (+ `context-sensitive-cursor` for the caret)
- left→right shimmer sweep through the loader letters → `ambient-glow-bloom` (single-pass traveling sheen) or `css-marker-patterns` (highlight sweep) — pick sheen for light-on-text, marker for a drawn band
- serif interstitial word-staggered fade in/out; status couplets swapping on a cadence → `dynamic-content-sequencing` (phrase windows) + `discrete-text-sequence` (the whole-state swaps); per-word stagger via `gsap-effects`
- pulsing "Thinking" label / three pulsing loading dots (phase-offset) → `sine-wave-loop` (finite repeats; kill the tween at the resolve beat — see doctrine note)
- status heading tense flip (Using→Used) / gray meta-lines fading in / final-token snaps → `discrete-text-sequence`
- label shrinks and docks to the top-left as a fixed corner header → `gsap-effects` (plain scale + translate tween; no dedicated rule needed)
- rapid camera push-in through the multi-panel workspace → `viewport-change` (the push) + `multi-phase-camera` (phasing) + optional `motion-blur-streak` (velocity blur as panels clear the frame)
- slow continuous zoom into the receipt card (header drifts off top) → `multi-phase-camera` (steady-push phase) or `viewport-change`
- summary card / progress pill / chat bubble / brand logo / file chip spring pop-in → `spring-pop-entrance`
- summary card glides up as the findings panel expands beneath → `gsap-effects` (the glide) + `anchored-layout-expand` (the panel)
- badge flip: numbered outline → solid circle + white checkmark with scale bounce → `scale-swap-transition` (outline↔solid swap at same center) + `svg-path-draw` (checkmark draw-in) + `spring-pop-entrance` (the bounce); the pending→active→complete progression itself → `dynamic-content-sequencing` (a snap state machine, per cursor-ui-demo's workflow-approve-press precedent)
- strikethrough + dim on the checked label → `css-marker-patterns` (strike-through draw) + `gsap-effects` (opacity dim)
- partially-drawn arc outlines animating on pending items → `svg-path-draw` (partial dashoffset, held mid-draw)
- viewport scroll down the final card / internal window scroll under a static frame → `gsap-effects` (transform-only content translate inside a masked window) — use `viewport-change` only if the FRAME moves
- green/red diff counters rapid tick-and-settle → `counting-dynamic-scale` (numeric proxy count-up; suppress the scale-growth component — these tick at fixed size)
- dark thread card scales up from a row to dominate the frame → `card-morph-anchor` (row → full-frame morph + handoff) with the background darkening as a `gsap-effects` overlay fade
- reply message / resolution line expands into place → `spring-pop-entrance` (soft overshoot) or `anchored-layout-expand` for a true downward growth
- reaction button springs into an active pill with overshoot + count → `spring-pop-entrance` (the pop) + `press-release-spring` (activation flavor) + `counting-dynamic-scale` (the count, if it ticks)
- camera push-in + pan-down centering the tool call / the payoff line → `coordinate-target-zoom` (non-centered target: scale + counter-translate) or `viewport-change`
- slight pull-back then gentle end drift → `multi-phase-camera` (pull-back phase + continuous micro-drift; keep the drift near-imperceptible)
- static hold on the final stack → no rule needed

**camera modifier** (default is a STATIC frame — the theater is element-level; at most ONE real move per shot, chosen from):

- Trigger push-through: a rapid push-in through the opening workspace that clears to the bare canvas → `viewport-change` + `multi-phase-camera`, optional `motion-blur-streak`.
- Receipt zoom: one slow continuous zoom into the checklist card across the whole mutation run, letting the header drift off the top → `multi-phase-camera` (steady push).
- Payoff push-in (sub-shape B's defining move): static through the build, then ONE push-in + pan-down tightening onto the confirmation line, easing to a micro-drift end → `coordinate-target-zoom` / `viewport-change` + `multi-phase-camera` (drift).
- Everything else — swaps, cascades, check-offs, scrolls — happens on a locked frame (any "scroll" is the content translating inside its window, not the camera).

**doctrine note (idle-motion ban)**: the working-state motifs (spinner rotation, pulsing dots, pulsing "Thinking") brush against motion-doctrine's idle-motion ban — here they are DIEGETIC: the pulse _performs_ "the machine is working" and is the narrative content of Scene 2, not decorative breathing. Keep every loop finite, timeline-driven, and seek-safe (`sine-wave-loop` finite repeats, `svg-icon-enrichment` rotation), and kill it at the exact frame the state resolves — the corpus does this explicitly (the loading dots vanish the instant the payload card expands; the spinner swaps out with the loader lockup).

# ASR Keyword Glow

Words in a phrase visually activate (glow blur + scale) when "spoken", following an attack-sustain-release envelope over per-word `{ start, end }` timestamps. In a real ASR pipeline the timings come from a word-level transcript (`hyperframes transcribe` — same shape); for promo video, hand-author them to control emphasis pacing. The envelope never falls to zero after a word — it decays to a rest level, leaving a breadcrumb of recent emphasis.

## How It Works

A single linear driver tween (`ease: "none"` — any other ease distorts the per-word envelope; do not change) sweeps scene time; its `onUpdate` loops over ALL words computing each one's envelope: 0 before `start`, linear attack to 1 over `ATTACK_DUR`, sustain at 1 until `end`, decay to `REST_LEVEL` over `RELEASE`, then hold at rest. The envelope drives `text-shadow` blur and `scale` — one driver for the whole phrase, never one tween per word (60+ words would bloat the timeline).

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="phrase">
  <span class="word" data-word="{w1Key}">{w1}</span>
  <span class="word" data-word="{w2Key}">{w2}</span>
  <!-- … the final word may be the brand, with the .brand modifier -->
  <span class="word brand" data-word="{brandKey}">{brandWord}</span>
</div>
```

```css
.phrase {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  justify-content: center;
  color: {restColor};
}
.word {
  display: inline-block; /* required for transform on <span> */
  transform-origin: 50% 50%;
  text-shadow: 0 0 0 {glowColorTransparent};
}
.word.brand {
  color: {brandAccentColor};
}
```

```js
// Per-word spoken windows — one entry per span; brand word 1.5-2× a normal word's window.
const TIMINGS = {
  // {w1Key}: { start: …, end: … },  — seconds, local to the scene
};

function envelope(time, start, end) {
  if (time < start) return 0;
  if (time < end) return Math.min((time - start) / ATTACK_DUR, 1);
  const releaseEnd = end + RELEASE;
  if (time < releaseEnd) return 1 - ((time - end) / RELEASE) * (1 - REST_LEVEL);
  return REST_LEVEL;
}

const words = document.querySelectorAll(".word");
const driver = { t: 0 };
tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: SCENE_DURATION,
    duration: SCENE_DURATION,
    ease: "none", // linear — t maps 1:1 to scene time
    onUpdate: () => {
      words.forEach((el) => {
        const timing = TIMINGS[el.dataset.word];
        if (!timing) return;
        const env = envelope(driver.t, timing.start, timing.end);
        el.style.textShadow = `0 0 ${MAX_BLUR * env}px ${glowColorRgba(env)}`;
        el.style.transform = `scale(${1 + MAX_SCALE_BOOST * env})`;
      });
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

`glowColorRgba(env)` returns the glow color with `env`-modulated alpha.

## Variations

- **Karaoke style (RECOMMENDED for video narration)** — the default amplitudes read too subtle in video: inactive words still dominate. Render inactive words DIM and lerp the active word toward bright + larger; at any moment 1–2 words are bright (spoken + lingering rest) and the rest is dim. Use for short phrases (5–10 words) where one word at a time should POP; keep the subtle default for long dense text. Pushes MAX_BLUR, MAX_SCALE_BOOST, and REST↔ACTIVE contrast; everything else identical:

```js
function lerpChannel(a, b, t) {
  return Math.round(a + (b - a) * t);
}
function colorAt(env, isBrand) {
  const target = isBrand ? BRAND_RGB : ACTIVE_RGB;
  return `rgb(${lerpChannel(REST_RGB.r, target.r, env)}, ${lerpChannel(REST_RGB.g, target.g, env)}, ${lerpChannel(REST_RGB.b, target.b, env)})`;
}
// in onUpdate: el.style.color = colorAt(env, el.classList.contains("brand"));
```

- **Multi-octave glow** — multiply the sustain by `1 + sin(driver.t × PULSE_HZ) × PULSE_AMPLITUDE` so high-emphasis words breathe at peak.
- **Color shift on the peak** — same channel-lerp from `restColor` → `peakColor` as `env` rises (non-karaoke form).
- **3D pop-out** — add `translateZ(env × MAX_POP_Z)` so the spoken word leans toward camera; requires `perspective` on the parent.
- **From real ASR transcripts** — convert `{ word, start_ms, end_ms }` entries to seconds and feed in identically.

## Values

| token           | default style        | karaoke style | notes                                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| ATTACK_DUR      | 0.1–0.25s            | same          | must be < the shortest word's window or it never reaches 1 |
| RELEASE         | 0.2–0.5s             | same          | decay to rest                                              |
| REST_LEVEL      | 0.15–0.4             | 0.05–0.2      | > 0 (breadcrumb), < 1                                      |
| MAX_BLUR        | 15–25px              | 30–45px       | bigger = "shouting"                                        |
| MAX_SCALE_BOOST | 0.03–0.10            | 0.15–0.25     | additive at peak (0.08 ⇒ scale 1.08)                       |
| PULSE_HZ / AMP  | 4–10 rad/s / 0.1–0.3 | —             | multi-octave variation                                     |
| MAX_POP_Z       | 20–60px              | —             | 3D variation                                               |
| SCENE_DURATION  | = `data-duration`    | same          | driver must end in sync with the scene's seek window       |

## Critical Constraints

- **Timings monotonic, non-overlapping** — every entry's `end` < the next entry's `start`; overlapping windows make the envelope ambiguous.
- **Brand word window 1.5–2× a normal word** — the brand is the headline; let it sustain.
- **Driver ease stays `"none"`** — any other ease warps every word's envelope timing.
- **`text-shadow`, not `box-shadow`** — the glow must hug the GLYPH (speaking emphasis), not the inline-block rectangle.
- **One driver looping all words** — never one tween per word.
- **Commit to a style** — values between the default and karaoke columns yield awkward "half-loud" emphasis.
- **Climax dwell ≥1s** after the final word's emphasis — the last word IS the headline beat.

# SVG Path Draw

Reveals an SVG shape by animating its stroke as if a pen were tracing it. Two stroke properties together: **`stroke-dasharray = <pathLength>`** makes the entire path one dash; **`stroke-dashoffset`** starts at the path length (dash shifted fully out of view → invisible) and tweens to `0` (fully drawn). The length comes from the DOM API `path.getTotalLength()` — measured, never guessed.

Works on anything with a stroke: `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`, `<ellipse>`.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<svg class="logo-mark" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path id="bar-left" d="M 60 40 L 60 160" />
  <path id="bar-right" d="M 140 40 L 140 160" />
  <path id="bar-mid" d="M 60 100 L 140 100" />
</svg>
```

```css
.logo-mark path {
  fill: none; /* outline-only draw — a fill would appear immediately and ruin the reveal */
  stroke: {accentColor};
  stroke-width: 12;
  stroke-linecap: round; /* softer endpoints */
  stroke-linejoin: round;
}
```

```js
// Setup: measure each path and set its dash pattern. Real measured geometry, not a magic number.
document.querySelectorAll(".logo-mark path").forEach((p) => {
  const len = p.getTotalLength();
  p.style.strokeDasharray = `${len}`;
  p.style.strokeDashoffset = `${len}`;

## Variations

- **Ring starting at 12 o'clock** — `<circle>` / `<rect>` strokes start at 3 o'clock by default; rotate the element `-90deg` so a progress ring draws from the top:

```html
<circle
  cx="100"
  cy="100"
  r="60"
  id="ring"
  style="transform-origin: 100px 100px; transform: rotate(-90deg)"
/>
```

- **Linear (constant-speed) draw** — `ease: "none"` for a steady-rate "real pen" trace.
- **Draw then fill** — for filled shapes, tween `fillOpacity: 0 → 1` AFTER the stroke completes (requires `fill-opacity: 0` initially and a real `fill` in CSS):

```js
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { fillOpacity: 1, duration: FILL_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  SEG_1_START + SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR,
);
```

## Values

| token             | range                                   | notes                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR  | 0.3–0.8s                                | fast snap vs deliberate pen trace; >~1s feels sluggish for a logo reveal                           |
| FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR | 60–80% of SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR              | proportional to segment length — a short connector at full duration reads slower than its siblings |
| SEG_N_START       | previous start + 70–80% of its duration | reads as continuous motion, not N isolated animations                                              |
| SEG_1_START       | 0–0.4s                                  | a small ~0.2s lead-in lets the viewer settle before motion                                         |
| BRAND_FADE_START  | ≥ last stroke end (+ ~0.2s beat)        | earlier and the wordmark competes with the draw                                                    |
| BRAND_FADE_DUR    | 0.3–0.8s                                | snap (urgent) vs glide (premium)                                                                   |

Ease families are discrete choices: **stroke draws** use `power2.out` (a hand lifting at end of stroke) or `none` for constant speed — never `back.out` / `elastic.out` (pens don't bounce). **Fades** use `power1.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **`fill: none`** for outline-only draws — otherwise the fill appears immediately.
- **Dasharray/dashoffset = the measured `getTotalLength()`**, set at setup; requires the SVG in the DOM (inline SVG is fine; a loaded `<image>` SVG is not).
- **Complex paths**: if `getTotalLength()` looks wrong, overestimate slightly (`len * 1.05`) — too large is invisible at animation start; too small clips the end.
- **Stagger multi-path draws at ~70–80%** of the previous segment's duration.
- **A drawn line must land on something.** When the path is a connector (rail, beam, underline, callout) rather than a shape, both endpoints must sit on real elements and the draw must do a job — reveal, route, validate, or emphasize. A stroke that only decorates empty space reads as filler; attach it or cut it.

## Frame 4 — Sirrok Agent

- type: product_intro
- duration: 5.5s
- transition_in: crossfade
- status: built
- src: compositions/frames/04-sirrok-agent.html
- blueprint: logo-assemble-lockup (Adapt)
- focal: assets/sirrok-agent-icon.svg · dựng bằng registry block `logo-outro` (đã cài), tắt glow bloom
- roles: sirrok-agent-icon.svg = cutout (hero) · 12 thẻ vai trò kế thừa từ Frame 02 = supporting (vật liệu dựng, tan hết ở 1.3s) · wordmark = supporting
- persuasion: Name the escape
- beat: đặt tên cho lối thoát
- scene: Các mảnh thẻ vai trò bay về tụ thành dome mark Sirrok, wordmark hiện dưới
- vo_file: public/audio/vo-04.mp3 (4.64s, ElevenLabs Daniel)
- voiceover: "Sirrok Agent. Một agent, gánh việc của cả ba mươi người."
- sfx: assemble swoosh into soft brand chime
- asset_candidates: "assets/sirrok-agent-icon.svg, wordmark Be Vietnam Pro ExtraBold, accent-line"
- narrative_role: "Đặt tên cho lối thoát đã hứa ở beat 1; dùng chính các mảnh pain làm vật liệu dựng logo"
- handoff_out: "dome mark — (960, 470), scale 1.0, opacity 1, đứng yên; wordmark Sirrok Agent ngay dưới tại (960, 640), opacity 1"

Adapt: giữ signature move **piece-by-piece assembly** của logo-outro, nhưng
mảnh là 12 thẻ vai trò thật từ Frame 02 chứ không phải shard trừu tượng — logo
được dựng từ chính vật liệu của pain. **Bỏ glow bloom và URL pill** của
blueprint: preset này zero-shadow, và CTA thuộc Frame 08.

Scene 1 (0.0–1.3s): 12 thẻ vai trò giữ nguyên vị trí cuối của Frame 02 rồi lao về tâm với `motion-blur-streak` hướng tâm, nén lại thành dome mark bằng **card morph-anchor** (uniform `scale`, không tween width/height). Layered-depth, 3 lớp, thẻ ngoài tới sau thẻ trong.
Scene 2 (1.3–2.2s): mark lock ở (960, 470) và **đứng yên từ đây tới hết frame**; accent-line `accent-fill` **svg self-draw** vẽ ra phía trên mark. Centered.
Scene 3 (2.2–3.4s): wordmark "Sirrok Agent" **per-word staggered reveal** vào **bên dưới** mark tại (960, 640) — không bao giờ chồng lên mark. Hierarchy: mark thắng bằng kích thước (3:1), wordmark thắng bằng weight 800.
Scene 4 (3.4–5.5s): dòng phụ "Một agent, gánh việc của cả ba mươi người." reveal đúng lúc lời thoại tới nó, `text-muted`; rồi **held read** 0.9s cuối, tĩnh.

## Selected blueprint: logo-assemble-lockup

# logo-assemble-lockup — Logo Assemble → Lockup

**intent**: A brand mark / wordmark comes to exist on screen and resolves into a centered logo lockup — built from parts (elements assemble or orbit in, letters cascade, an outline draws on, or a camera pushes through negative space), spring-BLOOMED whole from zero on a cleared stage, MORPHED in one unbroken chain out of the preceding phrase / glyph, absorbed from a kinetic streak, or already assembled and settling as decorations clear — optionally extended into a final URL / CTA / end card.

**roles served**

- Product_Intro (from product-intro-logo-system-assemble): A wordless, premium brand STING — an abstract system of elements pulses / grows / orbits and assembles around a FIXED central logo, carried by one cinematic camera tilt; no copy, no UI.
- CTA (from cta-camera-push-lockup): The logo build is a LEAD-IN to the final ask — a 3D mark assembles + wordmark cascades, then a fast camera PUSH-THROUGH the mark's negative space streaks giant CTA letters past the lens and resolves on a `[url]` / `[CTA verb]` lockup.
- CTA (from cta-button-wordmark-build): The "draws-its-own-outline → wordmark-builds-letter-by-letter" sub-shape — a `[CTA button]` pill strokes its own glowing border, a diagonal-band WIPE flips the frame, and the `[wordmark]` types in beside a slash to land the lockup. Camera static.
- Brand_Outro (from brand-outro-assemble-logo-lockup): The closing mark — a formation of `[feature pills / UI elements]` CLEARS the stage off all four edges, then on the empty frame the `[logo mark]` draws itself on stroke-by-stroke and the `[wordmark]` reveals to complete the lockup, then fades out.
- Product_Intro (from brand-reveal-assemble-zoom): a context-then-focus reveal — a companion tagline TYPES out to set context, the hero mark pops in beside it, then the companion exits as the layout recenters and the camera pushes IN to a held close-up on the mark (wide composition narrowing to a tight focus).
- Product_Intro (from logo-parts-lockup-assembly): the literal parts build — `[icon parts]` (a glowing dot traces a circle, semi-circles scale up and overlap, strokes rotate in) converge into the `[brand icon]` center-frame on a flat / gradient field, the `[wordmark]` joins (± a `[badge pill]` pops onto the lockup), then a payoff beat: a stepped bottom `[subtitle rail]`, a big `[count-up stat]` over a faint asset grid, or the lockup clears and a `[product UI window]` scales in. Static frame, all element-level.
- CTA (from text-clears-mark-blooms-lockup): the text-clear BLOOM — centered `[serif tagline]` beats (word-by-word staggered fades) hold, then CLEAR themselves to a blank frame; the `[brand mark]` spring-blooms from ZERO at dead center, slides left as the `[wordmark]` reveals to its right, and the balanced lockup holds (near-)still. Constant warm flat bg, static frame.
- Brand_Outro (from phrase-morphs-into-lockup): the MORPH chain — a centered `[phrase]` mutates in place, then collapses / swaps into an `[intermediate glyph]` whose line panels fan-and-flip around a central pivot with visible motion blur (page-flip feel) and interlock into the `[geometric mark]`, which slides apart into the lockup. One unbroken chain of transformation, never a cut-and-replace assembly; the finished lockup holds dead static for the final ~40–50% of runtime.
- Brand_Outro (from lead-text-then-mark-assembles): the parts-arrive build — a `[hand-off line]` holds and departs, then the mark is BUILT from arriving parts (`[icon]` drops in, letters slide in one by one, terminal punctuation lands, a confetti burst pops and instantly shrinks) OR a `[pixel stack]` streaks into full-width multicolor stripes whose tail retracts and is ABSORBED into the pixel mark — finishing as a lockup or a full end card (`[icon tile]` + `[title]` + `[URL pill]` + store badges) held static.
- Brand_Outro (from `settled-lockup-reveal`): the null-assembly boundary — the `[lockup]` is on stage from frame one; `[satellite shapes]` drift outward and fade, an accent underline sweeps beneath the wordmark, and the `[tagline]` wipes in to complete it. Settle-and-reveal: no predecessor beat, no morph, no relay.

**duration**: ~4.4–11.0s (Brand_Outro ~4.4–7.3s · brand-reveal ~5s · CTA text-clear bloom 6.0–8.9s · Product_Intro ~7s orbit sting, 7.0–9.8s parts-assembly · CTA push/build 5.4–11.0s)

**shot structure** (one consolidated time-coded template; `[slots]` are product-agnostic)

- Scene 1 — clear / ignite (0.0–~1.0s): the stage is prepared for the mark to build into.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro_: opens on a clean `[light bg]` with faint concentric guide rings under a flat top-down view; rings PULSE and expand from center; mid-beat the bg crossfades `[light]→[dark gradient: hero→secondary]`, tiny seed dots appear along the rings, and the central `[logo mark]`'s glow IGNITES (mark is present from t=0, fixed, front-facing).
  - _Variant — CTA push_: on a `[bg gradient]`, the `[logo mark]` is settling in object space (a 3D mark with thin wireframe edge-guides + a faint bracket motif behind center); a very slow continuous camera push-in may already be creeping.
  - _Variant — CTA button-build_: on a `[dark grid bg]`, a rounded `[CTA button "label"]` pill rises / scales into center (a prior headline clearing off the top); its thin border DRAWS ON as an animated glowing outline STROKE, with a small `[accent]` comet / spark icon at its left edge.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro_: a PRE-ARRANGED formation of `[feature pills / element grid]` (each `[icon]`+`[label]`) DISPERSES — elements slide outward from their laid-out positions and fly off all four frame edges (edge-clearing drift, NOT a center-origin burst), emptying the frame onto a clean `[bg]`.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro parts-assembly_ (from logo-parts-lockup-assembly): optional text hook — a centered "`[Meet product]`" line wipes away right→left — or straight into the build; on a flat / gradient `[bg]`, the first `[icon parts]` arrive: a glowing dot traces a clockwise circle, a gradient semi-circle scales up inside it, or the mark scales-up-with-rotate into center.
  - _Variant — CTA text-clear bloom_ (from text-clears-mark-blooms-lockup): a centered `[serif tagline / question]` (± an outlined `[badge pill]`) finishes a left→right word-staggered reveal in the first ~0.5–1s (each word passing light-grey→dark) and HOLDS; optional rolling word-by-word swap to a second `[availability line]`. Then the CLEAR: text exits — shrink-toward-center + fade, or word-by-word left-first fade-out — leaving a blank frame for a beat.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro morph-chain_ (from phrase-morphs-into-lockup): a centered `[phrase]` completes or mutates in place (a vertical slot-machine word swap — one word exits up as its replacement rises from below, rest of the line fixed — or a word-by-word landing) and holds. Nothing clears: the phrase IS the raw material for the mark.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro parts-arrive_ (from lead-text-then-mark-assembles): a centered `[hand-off line: tagline / "Brought to you by"]` holds on a flat canvas, then exits — slides straight down off-frame with fade, or fades away behind the incoming flourish.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro settled-reveal_ (from settled-lockup-reveal): the `[lockup]` is already centered at t=0; `[satellite shapes]` drift slowly outward around it — an INVERTED clear: the decorations leave, the mark stays.

- Scene 2 — assemble the mark (~1.0–~Ys): the mark builds itself from parts.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro_: seed dots SCALE UP into flat `[accent]` shapes arranged on the rings; concentric bands ripple outward (tunneling feel) and the shapes begin to ORBIT / drift around the still-fixed center.
  - _Variant — CTA push_: the `[wordmark]` CASCADES out from behind the mark (letters left→right with overshoot) into the full `[brand lockup]`; the 3D mark may assemble in beats (a terminal detaches + pops as a spring dot, a part hinges-open-and-snaps-shut elastic). Optional beat: a `[cursor]` arcs in and "clicks" the wordmark, OR a frosted-glass pill holding an intermediate `[CTA line]` springs in while layered mark shells fan to the edges.
  - _Variant — CTA button-build_: a graphic WIPE flips the frame to `[contrast bg]` — a thin `[accent]` diagonal line sweeps in, swells into a full-frame diagonal BAND, then collapses to a small `[accent]` slash.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro_: on the now-clear frame, the `[logo mark]` DRAWS ON via stroke (built arc-by-arc / segment-by-segment).
  - _Variant — Product_Intro parts-assembly_: the overlapping parts COMPLETE the `[brand icon]` (a second circle overlaps to close the orb; strokes interlock); the `[wordmark]` slides out from behind the icon or in from its right; a small `[badge pill]` pops onto the lockup.
  - _Variant — CTA text-clear bloom_: on the blank frame the `[brand mark]` scales up from ZERO at dead center with a snappy spring ease (slight overshoot, hint of rotation as it grows) — the whole mark at once, no parts.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro morph-chain_: the phrase collapses / wipes horizontally into the mark, OR is instantly swapped at the same center for a line-art `[intermediate icon]` whose strokes split into panels that fan-and-flip around a central pivot with visible motion blur, interlock-settling into the `[geometric mark]`. Never a cut to the finished logo — the transformation must stay unbroken.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro parts-arrive_: the mark is BUILT from arriving parts — the `[icon]` drops in from above, letters slide in one by one, terminal punctuation lands, a tiny confetti burst pops and instantly shrinks — OR a colored `[pixel stack]` pops in at a text edge, shoots horizontally stretching into full-width multicolor stripes, then the stripe tail retracts and is ABSORBED into the `[pixel mark]` (mask retraction).
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro settled-reveal_: an accent underline sweeps left→right beneath the `[wordmark]` — the only "build" this variant performs.

- Scene 3 — resolve to lockup (~Ys–end): the lockup completes and holds (Product_Intro / Brand_Outro) or is flown into / extended to a CTA (CTA variants).
  - _Variant — Product_Intro (the ONE camera move)_: the whole system smoothly TILTS from flat top-down into an angled isometric perspective (ease-in-out) with a slight zoom-out — flat shapes become luminous 3D forms, bands become glowing orbit lines, while the central `[logo mark]` does NOT tilt (stays 2D, front-facing, fixed). Camera eases to a stop; elements keep continuous orbit/drift (inner faster than outer); the mark holds its steady glow. Final settled frame.
  - _Variant — CTA push (the signature)_: a single fast CAMERA PUSH-THROUGH the mark's negative space / through the glass pill — heavy horizontal motion-blur, giant `[CTA]` letters streaking past the lens (cursor drops out). Resolves to the final lockup on a saturated `[bg]`: a `[url badge]` / `[CTA line]` revealed by a left→right WIPE carrying an `[accent]` leading edge (or a clean fade), with solid mark-shapes parallax-sliding in behind. Settles to a dead-static hold (slow zoom-out / settle).
  - _Variant — CTA button-build_: the `[wordmark]` BUILDS letter-by-letter to the right of the slash, landing on the final "`[slash] [WORDMARK]`" lockup centered on the new bg. Slow settle to static.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro_: the `[wordmark]` reveals beside the drawn mark (slide / fade) to complete the `[lockup]`; the lockup holds, then fades to `[black / bg]`.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro parts-assembly (the payoff beat)_: the finished lockup holds while a bottom `[subtitle box]` steps through `[tagline fragments]` (swap-in-place); or a big `[count-up stat]` line lands over a faint background asset grid; or the lockup scales-down / fades and a `[product UI window]` scales up on the flat bg (its panel content may swap once). The build hands off to product proof.
  - _Variant — CTA text-clear bloom_: the mark slides a short distance LEFT while the `[wordmark]` reveals to its right (letter-by-letter / slide-out wipe with visible partial states); the balanced "`[mark] + [wordmark]`" lockup centers and holds, one member continuing an almost imperceptible slow scale-up through the hold.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro morph-chain_: the mark slides left as the `[wordmark]` is pulled out rightward trailing a motion-blur streak, the pair decelerating into the centered lockup (± a `[sub-line]` fades in below). The hold is LONG — dead static for the final ~40–50% of runtime.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro parts-arrive_: the lockup rests centered and holds; or the full end card completes — a rounded-square `[icon tile]` scales up behind the mark, the `[title]` fades in word-by-word, and a bottom row (`[URL pill]` + `[store badges]`) fades / slides up — then holds static.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro settled-reveal_: the `[tagline]` reveals left→right below the wordmark; the satellites finish drifting out and fade; the lockup holds centered (at most a very slow global zoom-out, no pan).

**motion vocabulary**: ring pulse / expand; background crossfade (light→dark); glow ignite; seed-dot scale-up; continuous orbit / drift (inner faster than outer); single 3D perspective tilt (flat→isometric) + slight zoom-out around a fixed 2D anchor; 3D logo assemble (part detach + spring dot, clapperboard hinge / snap, shell fan-out); wordmark cascade with overshoot (letters left→right); button pill rise / scale-in; animated stroke-outline DRAW + glow (button border AND logo mark); comet / spark accent; diagonal-band wipe (sweep → swell → collapse-to-slash); letter-by-letter wordmark build; pre-formed grid DISPERSE off all four edges; logo-mark stroke-draw (sequential arcs / segments); fast CAMERA PUSH-THROUGH with motion-blur (CTA spine); continuous slow push-in / push-out; cursor arc-in + click; parallax shape slide-in; left→right URL/badge wipe with glowing leading edge; static / fade-out end-lockup hold; optional idle breathe on the held mark; glowing-dot circular path trace; part-overlap icon completion (semi-circles scale up + overlap); scale-up-with-rotate mark entrance; wordmark slide-out-from-behind-icon; badge pill pop onto the lockup; stepped subtitle swap-in-place (bottom rail); count-up stat tick over a faint asset grid; lockup shrink / fade → UI-window scale-up payoff; word-by-word staggered fade-through-grey (in, and left-first out); rolling word-by-word line swap; shrink-toward-center + fade clearing exit; whole-mark spring BLOOM from zero (overshoot + slight rotation); near-imperceptible continuous scale-up through the hold; vertical slot-machine word swap; horizontal phrase collapse / wipe into the mark; instant same-center text→icon swap; line-panel fan-and-flip morph around a central pivot with motion blur (page-flip feel); interlock-settle into the geometric mark; wordmark pull-out trailing a motion-blur streak; lead-line slide-down-off-bottom exit; icon drop-in from above; sequential per-letter slide-in + terminal punctuation landing; confetti burst pop-then-instant-shrink; pixel-stack pop at a text edge; horizontal streak-stretch into full-width stripes; stripe-tail retraction absorbed into the mark (mask retraction); rounded-tile scale-up enclosing the mark; bottom metadata row fade / slide-up (URL pill + store badges); satellite shapes outward drift + fade; left→right underline sweep; left→right tagline wipe-in.

**rule mapping** (per motion verb → `rules/<id>.md`)

- ring pulse / expand from center → `center-outward-expansion` (radiate from a shared center; reuse the 0→1 progress driver)
- background crossfade (light→dark gradient) → plain opacity/background tween via `gsap-effects` (no dedicated rule needed)
- glow ignite on the mark → `asr-keyword-glow` (envelope-driven glow on the brand element)
- seed-dot scale-up into shapes → `spring-pop-entrance` (scale-in pop; alt `scale-swap-transition` if dots morph into shapes)
- continuous orbit / drift around fixed center → `orbit-3d-entry` (flip-in then continuous elliptical orbit; center label = the fixed mark)
- single 3D perspective tilt (flat→isometric) + slight zoom-out → `multi-phase-camera` (scripted scale phases on a scene-wrapping camera, for the zoom-out) — see camera modifier; the FLAT→ISOMETRIC plane tilt of the whole stage is a CSS-3D perspective move (`techniques.md` CSS-3D, animating the stage's `rotateX`) — no exact camera rule for the plane-tilt, approximate via CSS-3D (closest reference is `orbit-3d-entry`'s "Tilted orbit plane" variation animated over time)
- fixed 2D anchor logo amid moving universe → no motion rule needed (static anchor; intentional — it's the absence of motion, the universe moves around it)
- 3D logo assemble — part detach + spring dot → `spring-pop-entrance` (spring pop, `back.out` overshoot)
- 3D logo assemble — hinge open / snap (clapperboard) → `hacker-flip-3d` (the 3D-rotate axis) + `techniques.md` CSS-3D (the elastic open-and-snap-shut hinge is an adaptation of the 3D-rotate)
- 3D logo assemble — shell fan-out to edges → `center-outward-expansion` (run outward from the mark center)
- wordmark cascade with overshoot (letters left→right) → recipe `gsap-effects` (per-element staggered slide) + `spring-pop-entrance` (the `back.out` overshoot per letter)
- button pill rise / scale-in → `spring-pop-entrance` (scale-in; alt `scale-swap-transition`)
- animated stroke-outline draw + glow (button border) → `svg-path-draw` (stroke-dashoffset draw) + `asr-keyword-glow` (the glow on the drawn stroke)
- comet / spark accent on button → `asr-keyword-glow` (small glow accent); motion path via `techniques.md` GSAP MotionPathPlugin (#9)
- diagonal-band wipe (sweep → swell → collapse-to-slash) → `techniques.md` clip-path reveal (#12, animate a `polygon(...)` diagonal across the frame; the swell-then-collapse-to-slash is the same clip-path reveal driven through grow→shrink keyframes)
- letter-by-letter wordmark build → `discrete-text-sequence` (smooth-slice / per-state build); recipe `gsap-effects` (typewriter / appending words)
- pre-formed grid disperse off all four edges → not a rule gap: a formation flying off-frame is an EXIT, and the pipeline forbids mid-video exits — the harness transition IS the exit (only the final frame may exit the stage). Treat this as transition-handled / final-frame-only rather than an in-scene motion rule. (If staged in-scene as a reveal-the-mark clear, it reuses `center-outward-expansion` run OUTWARD — center→target machinery interpolating formation→offscreen targets, out-easing.)
- logo-mark stroke-draw (sequential arcs / segments) → `svg-path-draw` (the canonical multi-segment stagger draw)
- wordmark slide / fade reveal beside drawn mark → `svg-path-draw` (its "brand-line fades in after stroke" tail) ; slide via `spring-pop-entrance`
- fast camera push-through with motion-blur → `multi-phase-camera` (a hard push phase) — see camera modifier; the heavy motion-blur streak itself → `motion-blur-streak` (directional velocity blur on the fast push-through)
- continuous slow push-in / push-out → `multi-phase-camera` (phase scale + drift)
- cursor arc-in + click on the wordmark → `cursor-click-ripple` (move → click → ripple); arc path via `techniques.md` MotionPathPlugin (#9)
- parallax shape slide-in behind lockup → `depth-scatter-assemble` (parallax depth slide-in of shapes at differing depths; pair with `3d-text-depth-layers` for the depth ordering)
- left→right URL / badge wipe with glowing leading edge → `techniques.md` clip-path reveal (#12, animate `inset()` left→right); the glowing leading edge → `asr-keyword-glow`
- static / fade-out end-lockup hold → no motion rule needed (terminal hold / opacity fade; intentional)
- idle breathe on held mark (optional) → `sine-wave-loop` (post-settle breathing)
- glowing-dot circular path trace → `svg-path-draw` (the traced circle draws on) + `techniques.md` MotionPathPlugin (#9) for the leading dot riding the path tip
- part-overlap icon completion / semi-circle scale-up → `spring-pop-entrance` (per-part scale-in; place parts at their final overlap positions from setup — the overlap IS the completed mark)
- scale-up-with-rotate mark entrance → `spring-pop-entrance` (add a rotation from-value to the pop)
- wordmark slide-out-from-behind-icon → recipe `gsap-effects` (x-slide) under a clip / overflow mask via `techniques.md` clip-path reveal (#12); z-order the icon above the sliding text
- badge pill pop onto the lockup → `spring-pop-entrance`
- stepped subtitle swap-in-place (bottom rail) → `discrete-text-sequence` (whole-state replacement at time thresholds); derive the windows via `dynamic-content-sequencing`
- count-up stat tick over a faint asset grid → `counting-dynamic-scale`; the faint grid is a plain opacity fade (no rule needed)
- lockup shrink / fade → UI-window payoff → `scale-swap-transition` (exit cluster shrinks + fades at center; window pops in with `back.out`)
- word-by-word staggered fade-through-grey (in / left-first out) → recipe `gsap-effects` (per-word staggered opacity + color tween). Deliberately a quiet FADE register — do NOT substitute `waterfall-entry` here; its binary-arrival doctrine is the wrong voice for this serif beat
- rolling word-by-word line swap → two overlapping `gsap-effects` word staggers at the same timeline position (old line out left-first, new line in left→right)
- shrink-toward-center + fade clearing exit → `scale-swap-transition` (its exit half; the entrance half is the bloom)
- whole-mark spring BLOOM from zero → `spring-pop-entrance` (single hero, `back.out` overshoot, slight rotation from-value)
- near-imperceptible continuous scale-up through the hold → no motion rule needed (one long linear micro-tween on the held lockup; intentional life-in-the-hold)
- vertical slot-machine word swap → `vertical-spring-ticker` (masked column, stepped tween — one word slot cycles, rest of the line fixed)
- horizontal phrase collapse / wipe into the mark → `scale-swap-transition` (same-center morph) with the collapse via `techniques.md` clip-path reveal (#12)
- instant same-center text→icon swap → no motion rule needed (`tl.set` hard swap; intentional — the chain's continuity lives in the NEXT beat's morph)
- line-panel fan-and-flip morph (page-flip, motion-blurred) → `hacker-flip-3d` (the per-panel 3D rotation axis) + `motion-blur-streak` (the blur) + `techniques.md` CSS-3D; true stroke-interpolation glyph morphs live in `hyperframes-keyframes` (SVG morph) — reach there if panels can't sell it
- interlock-settle into the geometric mark → `center-outward-expansion` machinery run INWARD (per-panel transform offsets tween to 0 in lockstep with one driver)
- wordmark pull-out trailing a motion-blur streak → `motion-blur-streak` (echo / ghost trail collapsing into the lead) on the x-slide
- lead-line slide-down-off-bottom exit → in-scene clearing beat; same doctrine as the grid-disperse row above (offscreen target + out-easing; prefer the harness transition when the exit IS the scene boundary)
- icon drop-in from above → `spring-pop-entrance` (y-offset from-value, overshoot on landing)
- sequential per-letter slide-in + terminal punctuation landing → `waterfall-entry` (staggered arrival cascade on a lateral axis; the punctuation is the cascade's final, heaviest beat)
- confetti burst pop-then-instant-shrink → `press-release-spring` ("release burst" variation) for a small deterministic burst; a true multi-particle confetti field → `particle-burst`
- pixel-stack pop at a text edge → `spring-pop-entrance` (tight stagger down the stack)
- horizontal streak-stretch into full-width stripes → plain `scaleX` stretch via `gsap-effects` (transform-origin at the stack) + `motion-blur-streak` for the streak read
- stripe-tail retraction absorbed into the mark → `techniques.md` clip-path reveal (#12) run in REVERSE (animated `inset()` retraction reading as mask absorption into the mark)
- rounded-tile scale-up enclosing the mark → `spring-pop-entrance` (scale-in BEHIND the mark; z-order only, mark never moves)
- bottom metadata row fade / slide-up → `spring-pop-entrance` (staggered group, ≤500ms cap)
- satellite shapes outward drift + fade → `center-outward-expansion` run OUTWARD (drift targets past frame edge) + opacity tail; if the drift must idle first, seed it with `sine-wave-loop`
- left→right underline sweep → `css-marker-patterns` (highlight sweep re-skinned as an underline) or `stat-bars-and-fills` progress-fill `scaleX`
- left→right tagline wipe-in → the existing "left→right URL / badge wipe" row applies unchanged (clip-path `inset()`)

**camera modifier** (the push / tilt)

- **CTA push-through** (the CTA spine): a scripted hard zoom phase on a scene-wrapping camera → `multi-phase-camera` ("Steady push" / "Bookend pull" pattern; push phase = the climax). When the mark is OFF-center and the camera must fly through a specific point of negative space, combine with `coordinate-target-zoom` (outer scales, inner counter-translates so the target negative-space point lands at viewport center as scale ramps; measure the offset at setup). The signature heavy horizontal MOTION-BLUR on the streak → `motion-blur-streak` (directional velocity blur on the push); realize with a CSS `filter: blur()` / duplicated-streak layer on the camera during the push window.
- **Product_Intro tilt** (the one cinematic move): the flat→isometric perspective tilt + slight zoom-out is a single scripted camera beat → `multi-phase-camera` (scale phase + the "Targeted zoom into off-center element" / drift machinery) for the zoom-out. `multi-phase-camera` is scale+translate+drift only, so the perspective-PLANE rotateX (flat top-down → angled isometric) of the whole stage is the CSS-3D move noted above — approximate via `techniques.md` CSS-3D, animating the stage's `rotateX` (closest reference is `orbit-3d-entry`'s "Tilted orbit plane" variation animated over time).
- **Static-frame variants**: the parts-assembly, text-clear bloom, morph-chain, parts-arrive, and settled-reveal variants are all COMPLETELY static-frame (element-level motion only; settled-reveal tolerates at most a very slow global zoom-out). The camera modifier applies only to the CTA push and the Product_Intro tilt.

## Selected motion rule: motion-blur-streak

---
name: motion-blur-streak
description: Fake directional velocity blur on a fast entrance or camera push-through — blur peaks at max speed and resolves to 0 at the settle, so the element streaks in then snaps sharp. Two paths — SVG feGaussianBlur on the motion axis, or an echo/ghost trail that collapses into the lead. Plus a per-frame-driven form for an element riding a baked track (tracked insert, shake-matched title): velocity-gated text-free silhouette ghosts (or a rotate/blur/counter-rotate filter sandwich when a true blur is the look), streak axis from the track delta.

# Motion-Blur Streak

Real motion blur isn't available to a seeked renderer (it integrates over shutter time), so this rule **fakes** it for a fast fly-in or hard camera push-through. The whole point is the _coupling_: the blur envelope rides the **same ease and window** as the position tween, so peak blur lands exactly on peak speed and the element is razor-sharp the instant it stops. Two paths:

- **(A) Directional SVG blur** — inline `<feGaussianBlur stdDeviation="X 0">` (X on the motion axis, 0 across it), tweened via a proxy. Cleanest; a true directional smear.
- **(B) Echo / ghost trail** — 2–4 duplicates at decreasing opacity, offset backward along the motion vector, collapsing into the lead as it settles. No filter cost; a stylized "speed-line" trail.

Both paths assume a **tween window** — an element driven per frame from a baked track has none; that form is the Per-Frame-Driven Carve-In below.

**Entrances and mid-shot moves only — never a mid-composition exit.** A blurred element fleeing off-frame mid-composition reads as a glitch; a hard exit between scenes is the transition's job (`../transitions/overview.md`). Two sanctioned scope extensions: the envelope may ride the **camera wrapper** during a travel leg (Camera-Travel Carve-Out), or become a per-frame function of a baked track for a **driven element** (Per-Frame-Driven Carve-In).

## How It Works

A fast `out`-eased move front-loads velocity — fastest off the start, bleeding to zero at the settle. Map the blur/echo envelope onto that same curve: position travels from an off-frame / pushed-back start to rest over `MOVE_DUR`; in lockstep on the same window and ease the smear goes `PEAK_BLUR → 0` (A) or the ghosts collapse onto the lead (B). By the settle the element is fully crisp and dwells ≥1 s — the contrast between violent streak and still, sharp settle IS the effect. GSAP can't tween an SVG attribute directly: tween a plain `{ v }` proxy and write `setAttribute("stdDeviation", …)` in `onUpdate`, seeding it once at setup so a seek to t=0 shows the streaked start.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip; overflow: hidden on the scene (the smear extends past rest) -->
<svg width="0" height="0" aria-hidden="true" style="position: absolute">
  <filter id="streak" x="-50%" y="-50%" width="200%" height="200%">
    <feGaussianBlur id="streak-blur" in="SourceGraphic" stdDeviation="0 0" />
  </filter>
</svg>
<div class="streak-el" id="streak-el" style="filter: url(#streak)">{phrase}</div>
<!-- Path B instead: N-1 aria-hidden .streak-ghost duplicates BEHIND the lead, no filter -->
```

```js
// Path A — proxy-tweened directional blur.
const blurNode = document.getElementById("streak-blur");
const blurProxy = { v: PEAK_BLUR };
const writeBlur = () => blurNode.setAttribute("stdDeviation", `${blurProxy.v} 0`); // X axis only
writeBlur(); // seed frame 0 — a seek to t=0 must show the streaked start, not a sharp pre-frame

tl.fromTo(
  "#streak-el",
  { x: ENTER_FROM_X, opacity: 0 },
  { x: 0, opacity: 1, duration: MOVE_DUR, ease: MOVE_EASE },
  MOVE_START,
);
tl.to(blurProxy, { v: 0, duration: MOVE_DUR, ease: MOVE_EASE, onUpdate: writeBlur }, MOVE_START);

// Path B — ghosts on the SAME window/ease; per-ghost variation by index.
gsap.utils.toArray(".streak-ghost").forEach((g) => {
  const i = Number(g.dataset.i); // 1..N-1, set in HTML
  tl.fromTo(
    g,
    { x: ENTER_FROM_X - i * ECHO_STEP_PX, opacity: GHOST_BASE_OPACITY / i },
    { x: 0, opacity: 0, duration: MOVE_DUR, ease: MOVE_EASE },
    MOVE_START,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Vertical streak** — swap axes: `y`, `stdDeviation="0 Y"`, vertical echo offsets.
- **Camera push-through** — `scale: SCALE_FROM → 1` with a symmetric `"B B"` envelope (depth-wise smear, not directional): the wordmark punches out of soft focus and snaps crisp at the lock.
- **Staggered grid streak-in** — each card streaks into its slot at `MOVE_START + i * CARD_STAGGER` with its own blur proxy / ghosts; sharp the instant it lands.
- **Hold-the-streak** — blur on a marginally slower curve than position (position `expo.out`, blur `power3.out`) so the last wisp resolves just after arrival. Sparingly; default is locked envelopes.

## Camera-Travel Carve-Out

The envelope is also sanctioned at **wrapper level**: on the `.world` / camera wrapper of a virtual-camera scene ([viewport-change.md](viewport-change.md), [multi-phase-camera.md](multi-phase-camera.md), [3d-camera-flight.md](3d-camera-flight.md)) during a **travel leg** — a dive, a whip sweep, a violent final push. This does **not** violate "never a mid-composition exit": the world never leaves frame — the camera travels _through_ it, and every leg ends with the world at rest, sharp, inside the frame. Each leg is an **arrival** at the next pose, so the entrance doctrine applies leg by leg. Three deltas from the element-level recipe:

- **Envelope follows the leg's ease.** An `out` leg (dive, final push) uses the base recipe unchanged. An `inOut` repositioning leg peaks mid-leg: split the envelope at the velocity peak — `0 → PEAK` on the in-half ease over the first half, `PEAK → 0` on the out-half over the second. Seed the proxy at **0** for these (the streaked state lives mid-leg, not at t=0; seed-at-`PEAK_BLUR` belongs to the entrance shape, where the first frame IS the fastest).
- **Filter placement.** 2D camera: `filter: url(#streak)` on the `.world` wrapper. 3D flight: on the **perspective stage** above the 3D context — a `filter` on a `preserve-3d` element flattens it and collapses every `translateZ`. Never per-element inside the world: one frame-wide envelope, not N desynced ones.
- **Full-frame blur is heavy** — cap `PEAK_BLUR` ~18–20 at wrapper level (vs 30 for one element); a brief whip may touch ~24. Axis rule as usual: `"X 0"` for a lateral whip/pan, `"B B"` for a dive/push.

### Whip sweep (named composition)

The heavily-blurred lateral whip that resolves into the next region — two rules on one window:

1. **Position** — [nudge-curve.md](nudge-curve.md)'s three-phase chain on the camera state, tuned burst-dominant (tail still ≥3× ramp-in in time).
2. **Blur** — `0 → PEAK` across the ramp-in, held at `PEAK` through the linear burst (constant velocity = constant smear), `PEAK → 0` across the tail.

Swap or reveal the next region's content DURING the burst — the smear masks the change; the `power4.out` tail lands it sharp. Reveal during the burst, read after the tail.

```js
tl.to(cam, { x: WHIP_X * 0.1, duration: 0.12, ease: "power3.in", onUpdate: applyCamera }, WHIP_AT);
tl.to(
  cam,
  { x: WHIP_X * 0.75, duration: 0.1, ease: "none", onUpdate: applyCamera },
  WHIP_AT + 0.12,
);
tl.to(
  cam,
  { x: WHIP_X, duration: 0.35, ease: "power4.out", onUpdate: applyCamera },
  WHIP_AT + 0.22,
);

tl.to(blurProxy, { v: PEAK_BLUR, duration: 0.12, ease: "power3.in", onUpdate: writeBlur }, WHIP_AT);
// blur holds at PEAK through the linear burst (no tween needed — value rests at PEAK)
tl.to(blurProxy, { v: 0, duration: 0.35, ease: "power4.out", onUpdate: writeBlur }, WHIP_AT + 0.22);
```

## Per-Frame-Driven Carve-In (baked tracks)

When the element is not tweened but **driven** — a tracked insert or callout riding a baked per-frame track, a title matched to camera shake — there is no move window to share. The envelope becomes a per-frame function of the track's own delta, computed in the same `onUpdate` that applies the position.

One element per transform, so no write clobbers another:

```html
<!-- .track: position + any fade, the only element either touches -->
<div class="track">
  <!-- ×2, the lead's box -->
  <div class="streak-ghost" aria-hidden="true" data-layout-allow-overlap></div>
  <!-- Path A only: rotate onto the travel axis; same box as .lead so both rotate about one center -->
  <div class="blur-wrap" style="filter: url(#streak)">
    <!-- counter-rotate only; no GSAP transform tweens on it -->
    <div class="lead">…</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```js
// inside the frame-lookup driver (an ease:"none" proxy → frames[i]); TRACK.x / TRACK.y are baked arrays
const j = Math.max(1, i); // frame 0 borrows the frame-1 delta so a seek to t=0 has a defined state
const dx = TRACK.x[j] - TRACK.x[j - 1];
const dy = TRACK.y[j] - TRACK.y[j - 1];
const speed = Math.hypot(dx, dy); // px per frame
const angle = (Math.atan2(dy, dx) * 180) / Math.PI; // the streak axis IS the travel direction
track.style.transform = `translate(${TRACK.x[i]}px, ${TRACK.y[i]}px)`;

// Path B, driven form (the default here): text-free silhouette clones trail the lead along −delta.
const base = speed > TRAIL_GATE ? Math.min(TRAIL_MAX, TRAIL_K * speed) : 0;
ghost1.style.transform = `translate(${-dx * 0.25}px, ${-dy * 0.25}px)`;
ghost2.style.transform = `translate(${-dx * 0.5}px, ${-dy * 0.5}px)`;
ghost1.style.opacity = String(base); // a fade on .track multiplies in; never read another tween's value
ghost2.style.opacity = String(base * 0.5);

// Path A, driven form: rotate a filter wrapper onto the travel axis, blur along X only, counter-rotate the content.
const sigma = speed > TRAIL_GATE ? Math.min(SIGMA_MAX, 0.5 * speed) : 0;
blurWrap.style.transform = `rotate(${angle}deg)`;
lead.style.transform = `rotate(${-angle}deg)`;
blurNode.setAttribute("stdDeviation", `${sigma} 0`);
```

Three deltas from the tweened recipe:

- **Ghosts are text-free silhouettes** — the lead's box, border, radius and fill with **no content** (`aria-hidden="true"`, `data-layout-allow-overlap`). A 25–50%-opacity clone reads as shape; a clone carrying the text reads as a duplicate element, and content-free clones give the layout and contrast checkers nothing to flag.
- **Velocity-gated, not window-shaped** — the trail exists only above `TRAIL_GATE` px/frame and scales with speed (`min(TRAIL_MAX, TRAIL_K × speed)`): a slow drift shows nothing, a whip shows a 180°-shutter smear. Fade `.track`, never `.lead`: group opacity takes the trail with it, and the ghost opacity stays a pure function of the frame index whatever order frames are seeked in.
- **Axis from the baked delta** — `atan2(dy, dx)` per frame; the streak follows the track around corners with nothing to seed at setup.

**Which path for a driven subtree.** Path B is the default: it costs no filter raster (a full filter region re-rasterizes every frame under per-frame drive), its clones carry no text so the layout and contrast checkers see nothing new, and it degrades to nothing when the track is still. Path A in the driven form is legitimate when a true blur is the look. Both forms measured deterministic on the reference host (2026-09-08: single-card 120-frame and three-card 450-frame drives of each path, hardware-GL and software lanes, every double render bit-identical) — but a per-frame-driven filter is the first thing to re-measure on a new host: keep the double-render frame-hash comparison (`--format png-sequence` twice) in the pipeline rather than trusting one clean run. One earlier build (2026-08) observed 1-LSB `feGaussianBlur` jitter under per-frame load and shipped Path B for that reason.

## Critical Constraints

- Blur peaks at peak speed and resolves to 0 at the settle — share the ease and window between position and envelope. A blur that lingers after the stop reads as a focus pull.
- Entrances / mid-shot arrivals only — never a mid-composition exit; wrapper-level use only per the Camera-Travel Carve-Out, per-frame-driven use only per the Per-Frame-Driven Carve-In.
- Seed `stdDeviation` at setup: at `PEAK_BLUR` for the entrance shape, at 0 for a whip / `inOut` leg.
- Generous filter region (`x="-50%" y="-50%" width="200%" height="200%"`) or the smear clips at the element's box edge.
- Directional axis: `"X 0"` horizontal, `"0 Y"` vertical, `"B B"` only for a depth/scale move — symmetric blur on a sideways move looks like defocus.
- Dwell ≥1 s sharp after the snap; a streak landing at the last beat reads as "flashed and gone".
- Heavy element on a solid field — thin type (< ~120px / 800 weight) or a busy backdrop swallows the smear.
- `overflow: hidden` on the scene — the smear / furthest ghost extends past the resting position during travel.
- Driven form: clones are text-free silhouettes (`aria-hidden`, `data-layout-allow-overlap`) inside the faded `.track`, axis from the baked delta; nothing is seeded at setup except the structural frame-0 state.

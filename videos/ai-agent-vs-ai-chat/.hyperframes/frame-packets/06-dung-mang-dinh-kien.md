## Frame 6 — Đừng mang định kiến sang

- status: built
- src: compositions/frames/06-dung-mang-dinh-kien.html
- scene: Một mũi tên cố vượt từ nửa trái sang phải và bị chặn lại
- duration: 8.88s
- transition_in: cut
- poster: 5s
- blueprint: comparison-split (Adapt)
- focal: khối "AI CHAT" bị bật ngược ở hairline
- roles: khối AI CHAT = foreground subject · hairline = supporting · dòng "thứ hoàn toàn mới" = foreground subject (vế phải)
- sfx: deep impact hit
- voiceover: "Đừng lấy trải nghiệm hay định kiến từ việc dùng AI chat cũ kỹ đó để đánh giá về Agent. Hãy coi Agent là một thứ hoàn toàn mới!"

Adapt: giữ bố cục split của cảnh 05, thêm một cú va chạm vật lý vào hairline.

Scene 1 (0.0–2.0s): nguyên trạng cảnh 05, khối trái gom thành một thẻ duy nhất **"định kiến cũ"**.
Scene 2 (2.0–3.6s): khối trượt sang phải, tới hairline thì khựng — physics-press-reaction: nén lại rồi bật ngược về chỗ cũ, overshoot nhẹ. Impact hit đúng frame va chạm.
Scene 3 (3.6–5.0s): hairline nháy sáng một nhịp rồi về `#1877F2` thường.
Scene 4 (5.0–7.0s): khi VO tới "thứ hoàn toàn mới", dòng chữ đó spring-pop entrance ở nửa phải, cỡ h2, màu xanh. Reveal lớn nằm ở nửa sau thời lượng.
Scene 5 (7.0–8.88s): giữ tĩnh cả hai vế.

## Selected blueprint: comparison-split

# comparison-split — Comparison Split-Cards

**intent**: Two paired items of equal weight shown side-by-side with mirrored 3D "book-open" tilts — the eye reads them as a balanced comparison, then a pill badge lands at each card's inner edge to punctuate. The motion IS the symmetry: two cards arriving from opposite wings into a held spread.

**roles served**

- Key_Feature (from `comparison-split-cards`): when two complementary features / capabilities of equal weight should be presented **simultaneously, not sequentially** — an A/B, a "X + Y together," paired concepts the viewer must weigh side-by-side. Not for >2 items (use `grid-card-assemble`) or sequential steps.

**duration**: 4–6s

**shot structure** (a `[bg]` canvas carrying two faint ambient glow blooms — `[accent A]` near 30%, `[accent B]` near 70% — so each side owns a color identity across a 50% symmetry axis; equal-width cards under one shared perspective parent)

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~0.8s) — title sets the concept.** A centered `[title line]` with an `[accent keyword]` slides DOWN into place from just above (a short smooth settle). The downward arrival is deliberate: it forms a non-conflicting T-shape against the cards, which arrive from the sides next.
- **Scene 2 (~0.4–1.9s) — the split-tilt entry (signature move).** Two equal-width feature cards arrive from opposite wings — `[left card]` from the left, `[right card]` from the right ~0.2s behind — each carrying a **mirrored 3D `rotateY` tilt** (left faces right, right faces left, opening like a book) and scaling ~0.85→1 as it lands. The entry overlaps the title's tail so the whole thing reads as ONE arrival, not two beats. Each card holds `[image / label / subtitle]`; box-shadows fall **outward** from the tilt (left shadow right, right shadow left).
- **Scene 3 (~1.9–end) — badges punctuate, then hold.** A pill `[badge]` lands at each card's **inner edge** (left then right, ~0.3s apart), overlapping its card ~15% so it reads as attached, not orbiting. This is the lone overshoot in the shot — it earns the punctuation. Settles and holds.

**motion vocabulary**: title slide-down from above; mirrored opposite-wing card entry; static book-open `rotateY` tilt (`+tilt` left, `−tilt` right); tilt-matched outward box-shadow; inner-edge badge spring-pop; gentle phase-opposed idle float (left vs right, never synchronized) registered as subtle jitter; dual side-glow ambient.

**rule mapping**

- two cards entering from opposite wings with mirrored `rotateY` tilts + tilt-matched shadow → `split-tilt-cards` (the signature; keep the two-layer split so the entry `x`/`scale` and the idle never collide on one alias)
- title slide-down settle → `gsap-effects` (translate + opacity on a long-tail `power3`)
- inner-edge pill badge pop (the one overshoot) → `spring-pop-entrance` (overshoot register — earns the punctuation)
- phase-opposed idle float on the pair → `sine-wave-loop` (low-amplitude register — subtle jitter, NOT lazy breathing; left `sin(t)`, right `sin(t+π)` so they never conveyor-belt)
- the two faint side glows behind the cards → `ambient-glow-bloom` (un-triggered soft bloom, one per accent)

**camera modifier**: camera-static by default — the symmetry is the subject and a move would break the balance.

# Physics Press Reaction (Cursor + Element Synced)

Models a real click: a cursor approaches a button, lands, and both compress IN SYNC, then release together. Distinct from [press-release-spring.md](press-release-spring.md) (no cursor — just a press happening); this rule is the COMBINED cursor + element behavior. A single `PRESS_INTENSITY` drives both: press down compresses both to `1 - PRESS_INTENSITY` via **one targets array**, release springs both back to 1.0 with overshoot. The cursor translates to the button's center BEFORE the press starts; after release it may move on or hold.

## Recipe

```html
<button class="btn" id="btn">{ctaCopy}</button>
<!-- Cursor at scene-root level so it translates freely; arrow TIP is the click
     point, so transform-origin: 0 0 — scaling around the tip keeps it stable. -->
<svg class="cursor" id="cursor" style="pointer-events: none; transform-origin: 0 0">…</svg>
```

```js
gsap.set("#cursor", { x: CURSOR_START_X, y: CURSOR_START_Y }); // off-screen / far corner

// Phase 1 — approach
tl.to(
  "#cursor",
  { x: BUTTON_CENTER_X, y: BUTTON_CENTER_Y, duration: APPROACH_DUR, ease: "power2.inOut" },
  APPROACH_START,
);

// Phase 2 — coordinated press down: ONE targets array, same scale
tl.to(
  ["#btn", "#cursor"],
  { scale: 1 - PRESS_INTENSITY, duration: PRESS_DOWN_DUR, ease: "power1.in" },
  PRESS_DOWN_AT,
);

// Phase 3 — release: both spring back together
tl.to(
  ["#btn", "#cursor"],
  { scale: 1, duration: RELEASE_DUR, ease: `back.out(${BOUNCE_FACTOR})` },
  RELEASE_AT,
);

// Phase 4 — inner glow during press, resting shadow on release (contact confirmation)
tl.to(
  "#btn",
  { boxShadow: "{btnPressedShadow}", duration: PRESS_DOWN_DUR, ease: "power1.in" },
  PRESS_DOWN_AT,
);
tl.to(
  "#btn",
  { boxShadow: "{btnRestingShadow}", duration: RELEASE_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  RELEASE_AT,
);

// Cursor optionally exits after the press settles
tl.to(
  "#cursor",
  { x: CURSOR_EXIT_X, y: CURSOR_EXIT_Y, duration: CURSOR_EXIT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  CURSOR_EXIT_AT,
);
```

## Variations

- **Multiple-element chain press** — press button A → A triggers a swap → cursor moves to button B → presses again; each press is one full down-release sub-routine.
- **Hold press (continuous pressure)** — insert a `HOLD_DUR` window between press-down and release: both scales stay at `1 - PRESS_INTENSITY`, inner glow stays on. Suggests "thinking" or "loading."
- **Synchronized inner-glow pulse** — during the hold, pulse the inset glow with a sine driver: a `{ p: 0 }` proxy tweened to `Math.PI * GLOW_PULSE_CYCLES * 2` on `ease: "none"`, `onUpdate` writing `boxShadow` with `alpha = GLOW_BASE_ALPHA + sin(p) * GLOW_PULSE_AMP`. Suggests "processing."

## Critical Constraints

- **Same press scale on cursor AND button** (one targets array) — only the button scaling makes the cursor "tap on air"; only the cursor scaling makes the button feel disconnected.
- **Cursor arrives BEFORE the press starts** — a clear "cursor over target" moment, or the press is unattributed.
- **`back.out(BOUNCE_FACTOR)` on the release, for both together** — a linear release loses the tactile feel; release MUST come after press.
- **Inner glow appears DURING press, fades on release** — outer shadow shrinks (pushed in), inner glow appears (energy concentrated).
- **Cursor `transform-origin: 0 0`** — the arrow's tip is the click point; scale around the tip keeps it stable. `pointer-events: none` on the cursor.
- **Climax dwell ≥ 1 s** — after release the composition must continue ≥ 1 s; the press is a beat, the viewer needs time to see the result.
- **No real `mouseenter` / `click` events** — HF is a render context; everything runs via the timeline.

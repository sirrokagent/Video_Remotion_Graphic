## Frame 11 — Bài tập 1: cờ caro

- status: built
- src: compositions/frames/11-bai-tap-1-co-caro.html
- scene: Một câu lệnh gõ ra, rồi bàn cờ caro tự dựng lên
- duration: 9.71s
- transition_in: cut
- poster: 6s
- blueprint: prompt-type-submit-generate (Reproduce)
- focal: câu lệnh được gõ, rồi bàn cờ
- roles: ô nhập + câu lệnh = foreground subject (component `typewriter`) · lưới cờ = foreground subject (kế nhiệm) · nền = background
- sfx: UI click tick, deep impact hit
- voiceover: "Bài tập 1: Gõ đúng một câu duy nhất: 'Hãy tạo cho tôi một phần mềm chơi cờ caro trên máy tính, bật sẵn lên để tôi chơi.' Nói xong rồi chỉ cần ngồi xem nó tự thao tác."

Scene 1 (0.0–1.4s): nhãn **"một câu duy nhất"** hiện trên, ô nhập hairline rỗng ở giữa khung.
Scene 2 (1.4–4.4s): type-on with caret — câu lệnh gõ ra từng ký tự trong ô nhập (component `typewriter`, caret deterministic), tick nhỏ theo nhịp gõ chứ không mỗi ký tự.
Scene 3 (4.4–5.2s): ô nhập press-release-spring khi submit, impact hit.
Scene 4 (5.2–7.6s): ô nhập co và mờ đi; lưới cờ caro 3×3 svg-path-draw từng đường một ở giữa khung.
Scene 5 (7.6–9.0s): quân X và O hiện lần lượt theo thứ tự cố định viết sẵn, spring-pop từng quân, stagger đều.
Scene 6 (9.0–9.71s): nhãn đổi thành **"ngồi xem"**, giữ tĩnh.

## Selected blueprint: prompt-type-submit-generate

# prompt-type-submit-generate — Prompt, Submit, Generate

**intent**: The AI-era demo shot — a `[prompt / query / command]` types character-by-character into a REAL product input (chat composer, search bar, terminal prompt, URL bar, sidebar assistant) and the machine answers: status theater into a streaming answer / agent action log / diff cards / chart / generated artifact — or the clip cuts at the submit and the ask itself is the show. The keyboard is the actor and the product is the responder. Distinct from `typewriter-reveal` (a line typed as bare typography on an empty field — no product surface, nothing answers) and from `cursor-ui-demo` (a cursor clicking a reconstructed UI through states — there the pointer drives every change; here any cursor work only primes the input or lands the submit, and every state change after that is the machine's own doing).

**roles served**

- Hook (from `app-window-push-in-prompt-typing`): when the opener is "watch me ask" — typed headline beat(s), ONE eased push-in lands tight on the product's input, the prompt types and the clip ends at / just after submission (sub-shape A).
- Hook (from `typed-command-output-scroll`): when the demo loop ITSELF is the hook — command in, output builds and scrolls, and a second command / retype starts before the cut, ending mid-action (sub-shapes B/C with the restart ending).
- Product_Intro (from `prompt-typing-composer`): when the first look at the product IS its composer — a brand beat opens onto the input surface, a long prompt types with hovers / attachments / dropdown picks, and the camera steers gently toward the input or the confirming control (sub-shape A, occasionally running through to an agent-log payoff).
- Product_Intro (from `search-query-walkthrough`): when the product is introduced through its search affordance — a short `[query]` types with a blinking caret, autocomplete / results populate LIVE, and a confirm click settles the result state (sub-shape C, search skin).
- Key_Feature (from `prompt-type-submit-generate`): when the capability is demoed as ONE prompt→response round trip — submit into thinking/status states, then a streaming answer, action-log rows with brand icons, green diff cards, a chart drawing itself, or an instant generated-app reveal (sub-shapes A/B/C — the family's widest role).
- CTA (from `install-command-end-card`): the install-command end card — the closing `[headline]` DEMOTES (shrinks, grays, lifts) to make room for a `[terminal pill]` that springs in and stretches wide, the `[install command]` types out with a blinking cursor, flanking metadata and a `[tool-icon row]` pop in, and the finished card holds long. No submit, no response — the typed command IS the ask (sub-shape A, terminal skin).

**duration**: 5.2–12s (A prompt-as-hook 5.2–12s, incl. the ~7.4s CTA end card; B full generate loop 5.45–11.9s; C instant-result surface 5.7–11.9s — a long-form family: most members run 7–12s because the response needs room to arrive)

**shot structure** (a `[product input]` on/inside a `[product surface — app window, web page, terminal, browser chrome, sidebar]` over `[bg color]`; the input is the gravitational center — the camera makes at most one or two purposeful moves toward or away from it and is otherwise LOCKED; typing is character-by-character behind a visible caret, and response content arrives progressively, never dumped; three folded sub-shapes — **(A) prompt-as-hook**: the clip ends at / just after the submit (or mid-word), the ask is the show; **(B) full generate loop**: submit → status theater → the output builds block by block; **(C) instant-result surface**: the machine answers with a finished surface, often re-queried before the cut)

- **Scene 0 (optional, 0.0–~2s) — lead-in beat.** ONE establishing move before the input owns the shot: a `[headline]` types on centered and clears; a `[title card]` hard-cuts away; a brand beat (`[logo/mascot]` centered, `[serif title]` building in word groups, logo shrinking-and-rising to dock top-center); an `[orb / mark]` forms with a glowing rim; the `[app window]` flies in with motion blur and settles; or a full-frame `[thumbnail grid]` parts at its vertical centerline to clear the stage. Keep it ≤2s — the input is the star.
  - _Variant — Hook_: typed headline beats carry the intro — "[Introducing X]" types on, holds, is replaced by the `[tagline]` typing in the identical style; the typing register is established before the product ever appears.
  - _Variant — Key_Feature_: the capability claim types as a bare title ("[Run a task across multiple models.]") then hard-cuts to the surface — or skip Scene 0 entirely and open on the live surface mid-workflow.
  - _Variant — CTA_: the `[closing line]` types on in two steps ("[Designed.] [Not generated.]") and holds — it will demote in Scene 2.

- **Scene 1 (~1–3s) — the input takes focus.** The `[product input]` arrives or is primed: a `[pill bar]` EXPANDS sideways from the mark/chip; a `[prompt palette / card]` SPRINGS in at center with a soft shadow; ONE smooth eased/accelerating push-in crops tight onto the composer inside the `[app window]` (headline chrome slides out of frame); a `[⌘K search modal]` springs to center while the page blurs behind it; a cursor clicks a `[menu row / Assistant button]` and the prompt block appears; or a `[✕ clear button]` empties the previous query back to `[placeholder]`. Optional composer ritual (pick 1–2, before or during typing): an `[attachment]` drags in and settles in a tray below the input; a `[model / option dropdown]` opens beneath the selector, rows hover-highlight, a checkmark lands and the toolbar label updates.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro_: the ritual is the introduction — a `[chip grid]` fades in and the cursor arcs across 2–3 hover highlights before clicking the one that opens the composer; the affordances are the tour.
  - _Variant — Key_Feature_: the surface already carries an old `[query]` and its previous `[result panel]` — clearing it says "this is a working tool, not a mockup".

- **Scene 2 (~2–6s) — the prompt types (the engine).** The `[prompt text]` types rapidly character-by-character behind a blinking caret; the input card GROWS downward / wraps as text fills, pushing footer controls and attachments down; a typed `[token]` may convert into an inline `[brand pill]` mid-typing (`[@browser]` → a colored `[Browser]` chip, typing continues around it); the camera may run ONE slow continuous push-in toward the input, decelerating to a near-hold on the typed ask. Sub-shape (A) may END here — cut mid-word with the caret blinking, or held on the finished prompt.
  - _Variant — Hook (A)_: the typed ask is the cliffhanger — end on the completed prompt, or on the submit click as the interface DIMS at the cut.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro (A)_: the camera dives toward the bottom input while `[option pills]` cascade in above it; the prompt is still mid-word at the cut — the product is introduced as something you talk to.
  - _Variant — CTA (A, install end card)_: the Scene-0 headline DEMOTES — scales ~50%, desaturates to gray, lifts upward — as a small `[$ chip]` spring-pops below and STRETCHES horizontally into a wide `[terminal pill]`; the `[install command]` types out inside it; a faint `[repo link]` and a "[Works with]" label fade in quietly; a row of `[tool icons]` pops in one after another with soft spring scale; the finished composition holds long, only the caret blinking.

- **Scene 3 (~4–7s) — submit + machine theater.** The `[submit control]` is clicked (cursor glide + press dip; the button may have MORPHED state on first keystroke — waveform → up-arrow — and may flip to a `[stop]` control while streaming) or the retype implies enter. The surface answers instantly with a working state: prior content VANISHES (chip grid gone, panel collapses to its slim header, whole layout swaps); then the theater — `[status phrases]` cross-dissolve with a left-to-right shimmer sweep ("[Thinking]" → "[Modeling…]" → "[Planning…]"), a `[spinner]` rotates over a loading strip, a row of `[loading cards]` lines up, or a `[checklist]` populates and its items flip one by one to green checks with strikethrough while a `[status heading]` flips tense ("[Using X]" → "[Used X]").
  - _Variant — (A) status-flare exit_: end the clip ON the theater — "[Generating…]" / the rotating spinner — the flare is the button; the answer is left to the imagination.

- **Scene 4 (rest) — the answer arrives.** Choose by sub-shape:
  - **Sub-shape B (full generate loop)**: the output BUILDS progressively, each block pushing content down — `[answer text]` streams paragraph by paragraph; `[action-log rows]` pop in sequentially, each with a `[brand icon]`; `[diff cards]` expand with green-highlight added lines; `[chart lines]` draw staggered left-to-right from a shared origin; an `[ASCII / summary table]` draws in; live counters tick; the surface auto-scrolls vertically to follow the newest line (page, terminal, or in-card scroll) — often under ONE slow continuous push-in on the result window.
  - **Sub-shape C (instant-result surface)**: the machine answers with a finished surface — the matching `[result / article]` renders in place; `[autocomplete chips]` stagger-pop below the bar WHILE the query types (the machine answers every keystroke), then a hover fills the `[Search button]` solid and a click confirms; the `[generated page]` rises as a rounded card and SCROLLS continuously beneath the pinned prompt; a blur-whip resolves onto the `[artifact window]` and a tab click FLIPS code → preview; or a zoom-out reveals the prompt pill was inside a full `[workspace]` where the `[content]` rewrites itself live.

- **Scene 5 (final beat) — resolve.** Diverges by role and sub-shape:
  - _Variant — Key_Feature (hold)_: HOLD on the completed output — chart finished, diff cards + `[action buttons]` fully rendered; no fade-out, no blank end frame.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro (confirm)_: the cursor lands the confirming click (`[Create PR]` / `[Generate]` / `[Search]`) as the clip ends, or extras fade and a final push-in leaves the clean end state; one member hard-cuts to a minimal `[end card]` — the submit button alone at dead center with a settle pop.
  - _Variant — Hook (restart — the signature)_: a SECOND `[prompt / command]` starts typing at a fresh prompt line, or the query BACKSPACES-AND-RETYPES and the output swaps wholesale to `[result 2]` — the clip ends MID-ACTION, mid-scroll or mid-word: the loop is endless, and that is the point.
  - _Variant — CTA_: the end card from Scene 2 simply holds to the last frame; the blinking cursor is the only motion.

**motion vocabulary**: character-by-character typing with blinking caret / block cursor; typed-headline beats replacing each other; input pill grows / wraps downward into a multi-line box; prompt palette / card springs in; pill bar expands sideways from a mark or chip; orb formation with glowing rim; typed token → inline brand-pill morph mid-typing; placeholder clear; ✕-click query clear; backspace-and-retype query swap; attachment drag-in and tray settle; dropdown open + row hover-highlight + checkmark select + toolbar label update; chip-grid hover dance; cursor glide / arc with hover highlight fills; click press dip; submit-button state morph (waveform→up-arrow, submit→stop); hover fill-state swap on a Search button; content vanish / panel collapse / layout swap on submit; status-phrase cross-dissolves with left-to-right shimmer sweep; pulsing "Thinking"; spinner rotation; loading strip; animated trailing dots; loading model-card row; status-heading tense flip (Using→Used); checklist squares flipping to green checks with strikethrough; action-log rows popping in sequentially with brand icons; streaming text blocks pushing content down; green-highlight diff cards expanding; staggered left-to-right chart line-draws; ASCII / summary table draw-in; count-up ticker; vertical output scroll (page / terminal / in-card) following the newest line; generated page rising as a rounded card and scrolling beneath a pinned prompt; autocomplete chips rapid stagger-pop; code↔preview instant flip on tab click; blur-whip transition; prompt jumps to a heading on submit; zoom-out reveal from prompt pill to full UI window; single eased / accelerating push-in landing on the input; slow continuous push-in on the result window; window fly-in with motion blur; zoom + pan cropping browser chrome; ⌘K modal spring-in with background blur; full-frame grid parting at the vertical centerline; headline demotion (scale-down + desaturate + lift); chip horizontal-stretch into a wide terminal pill; quiet low-contrast metadata fade-ins; sequential spring pop-ins of an icon row; second prompt typing at the cut; interface dim / fade at the cut; long static end hold with blinking cursor.

**rule mapping**

- character-by-character typing, placeholder clear, backspace-and-retype, second prompt at the cut, typed-headline beats → `discrete-text-sequence` (typing / typos / holds / backspace) backed by `gsap-effects` (typewriter recipe)
- blinking caret / block cursor (persisting through holds) → `context-sensitive-cursor`
- prompt / status / output phrase windows, script-driven beat durations → `dynamic-content-sequencing`
- input card grows downward / wraps as text fills → `anchored-layout-expand` (top-anchored downward growth, stepped at wrap boundaries)
- typed token → inline brand-pill morph mid-typing → composition: `scale-swap-transition` (token→chip swap at the conversion threshold) + `card-morph-anchor` (the reflow around the chip)
- prompt palette / modal / dropdown springs in; loading cards, log rows, diff cards, autocomplete chips, icon rows arriving staggered → `spring-pop-entrance` (single hero or staggered group)
- pill bar expands sideways from a mark; chip stretches into a wide terminal pill → `card-morph-anchor` (container morph)
- cursor glide to a control, press, ripple → `cursor-click-ripple`; the press dip + recovery → `press-release-spring` (or `physics-press-reaction` for cursor+button compressed together)
- hover highlight fills, Search-button instant solid fill, UI keyword accents → `asr-keyword-glow` (static-timeline glow variant) or `press-release-spring` (color-transition variation)
- attachment drag-in with cursor → `context-sensitive-cursor` (pointer↔grab) + `spring-pop-entrance` (tray settle)
- content vanish / layout swap / panel collapse on submit; code↔preview instant flip → `scale-swap-transition` (paired same-center swap) or a hard `tl.set` state swap via `discrete-text-sequence` semantics
- prompt jumps to a heading on submit → FLIP reposition — see `hyperframes-keyframes` (FLIP); the travel itself via `nudge-curve` (slow-fast-slow group slide)
- status-phrase cross-dissolves with shimmer sweep → `discrete-text-sequence` (phrase swaps) + `ambient-glow-bloom` (Shimmer sweep variation — single-pass traveling sheen, clipped to the text)
- spinner rotation, animated trailing dots, pulsing loader glyphs → `svg-icon-enrichment` (rotating / pulsing internal SVG elements); the bounded "Thinking" pulse → `sine-wave-loop` (finite repeats — this pulse PERFORMS status, it is not idle wobble)
- checklist state flips, status-heading tense flip, status-pill swaps → `discrete-text-sequence` (discrete state stepping); the checkmark stamp → `svg-path-draw` or `spring-pop-entrance`
- streaming text blocks / log rows pushing content down → `dynamic-content-sequencing` (per-block windows) + `spring-pop-entrance` (per-row arrival)
- vertical output scroll following the newest line (page / terminal / in-card) → composition: content translateY keyed to the same timeline as the content windows + a matched `viewport-change` counter-pan when the frame itself travels
- generated page as a rounded card whose internal content scrolls → `3d-page-scroll` (flat variant — internal scroll of a page card)
- staggered chart line-draws → `svg-path-draw` (stroke-dashoffset, staggered starts)
- count-up ticker / live counters → `counting-dynamic-scale`; result bars / fills → `stat-bars-and-fills`
- single eased push-in landing on the input; slow continuous push-in on the result → `multi-phase-camera` (push phase) with the destination framed via `coordinate-target-zoom`
- zoom-out reveal from prompt pill to full workspace; zoom + pan cropping chrome → `viewport-change` (composite pan+scale on the `.world` wrapper)
- window fly-in with motion blur; blur-whip transition → `motion-blur-streak`
- ⌘K modal with background blur → `depth-of-field-blur` (blur the page plane, keep the modal sharp) + `spring-pop-entrance`
- full-frame grid parting at the vertical centerline → `center-outward-expansion` (halves glide outward in lockstep)
- orb formation with glowing rim → `ambient-glow-bloom` + `spring-pop-entrance`
- headline demotion (scale-down + desaturate + lift) → `gsap-effects` (plain composite tween; no dedicated rule needed)
- interface dim at the cut, hard cut to a minimal end card, end mid-word / mid-scroll → exit conventions, no rule needed
- long static end hold with only the caret blinking → `context-sensitive-cursor` (the blink is the sanctioned residual motion)

**camera modifier** (the camera always serves the ask or the answer; many members are fully camera-static — typing, submit theater, and streaming carry the shot)

- ONE smooth eased / accelerating push-in that lands tight on the input and LOCKS (Hook, Product_Intro) → `multi-phase-camera` (push) + `coordinate-target-zoom` (target the input) — the defining move of the "watch me ask" opener.
- ONE slow continuous push-in running under the typing or under the output build, decelerating to a near-hold (Product_Intro, Key_Feature) → `multi-phase-camera` — gives the response weight without stealing from it.
- ONE zoom-out reveal — the prompt pill turns out to live inside a full workspace (Key_Feature, sub-shape C) → `viewport-change` (pull-back) — the inverse move; the ask was closer to the product than you thought.
- Entry-only flourishes: window fly-in with motion blur (`motion-blur-streak`), zoom + pan cropping browser chrome (`viewport-change`) — both settle before typing starts.
- Never more than two real viewport moves per shot; the frame is LOCKED during submit theater and streaming (the content scrolls, the camera does not).

# Press-Release Spring Chain

Separates input (linear compression) from output (spring recovery) to create tactile feel: the overshoot is a natural byproduct of the spring config, not manually coded, with secondary motion (shadow shrink, release burst, background glow) layered on the same trigger frame. This is a **reaction on an element already resting on screen** — an arrival that springs in from nothing is [spring-pop-entrance.md](spring-pop-entrance.md); add a visible cursor actor and it becomes [physics-press-reaction.md](physics-press-reaction.md).

Two phases split at the **release**:

1. **Press**: linear ease → compression (`scale: 1 → PRESS_SCALE`, shadow shrinks). Linear, not spring — the dip must read as instant/tactile, not squishy.
2. **Release**: `back.out(BOUNCE_FACTOR)` spring back to 1.0. Optional burst glow ring expands behind the button; optional environmental glow fades in.

State continuity is critical: the release tween's start value MUST equal the press tween's end value, or the spring snaps to a different position. GSAP threads this automatically when both tweens target the same property at **adjacent positions** — `RELEASE_START = PRESS_START + PRESS_DUR`; a gap or overlap breaks it.

## Recipe

```html
<div class="press-stage">
  <div class="bg-glow" id="bg-glow"></div>
  <!-- Burst sits BEHIND the button (z-index 1 vs 2), same footprint, blurred
       radial gradient, opacity 0. bg-glow is a full-stage radial at negative
       inset so it extends past the stage edges. -->
  <div class="burst" id="burst"></div>
  <button class="btn" id="btn">{buttonLabel}</button>
</div>
```

```js
// Phase 1 — press (linear compression)
tl.to(
  "#btn",
  { scale: PRESS_SCALE, boxShadow: "{btnPressedShadow}", duration: PRESS_DUR, ease: "power1.in" },
  PRESS_START,
);

// Phase 2 — release (spring back; start scale == PRESS_SCALE by adjacency)
tl.to(
  "#btn",
  {
    scale: 1,
    boxShadow: "{btnRestShadow}",
    duration: RELEASE_DUR,
    ease: `back.out(${BOUNCE_FACTOR})`,
  },
  RELEASE_START,
);

// Phase 3 — burst glow pops behind the button, then fades
tl.fromTo(
  "#burst",
  { scale: 1, opacity: 0 },
  {
    scale: BURST_PEAK_SCALE,
    opacity: BURST_PEAK_OPACITY,
    duration: BURST_GROW_DUR,
    ease: "power2.out",
  },
  RELEASE_START,
);
tl.to("#burst", { opacity: 0, duration: BURST_FADE_DUR, ease: "power2.in" }, BURST_FADE_START);

// Phase 4 — environmental glow fades in after release
tl.to(
  "#bg-glow",
  { opacity: BG_GLOW_PEAK_OPACITY, duration: BG_GLOW_FADE_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  RELEASE_START,
);
```

## Variations

- **Subtle press** (status save / muted CTA): `PRESS_SCALE` ~0.96, `BOUNCE_FACTOR` ~1.4, burst scale/opacity reduced.
- **Dramatic press** (hero CTA / "ship it"): `PRESS_SCALE` ~0.88, `BOUNCE_FACTOR` ~2.5, burst maxed.
- **Color shift during press** — darken mid-press, return on release; interpolated `backgroundColor` at the same timeline positions as the scale tweens. Same state-continuity rule.
- **State change at release** (approve / confirm) — instead of returning to the rest color, swap to `{successColor}` at `RELEASE_START` and pop a checkmark via a separate `back.out(CHECK_BOUNCE)` tween (1.4–2.0, firmer than the button's bounce — a punctuating "stamp"; pop 0.3–0.6 s) at the same position. The button is now terminal — no further presses expected.

| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| button footprint     | ≥ 3–5% of canvas area                      | a 320×68 button at 1080p is ~1% and the press reads as visually insignificant              |
| PRESS_SCALE          | 0.88 dramatic · 0.92 default · 0.96 subtle | never <0.85 (broken) or >0.98 (no perceptible dip)                                         |
| PRESS_DUR            | 0.10–0.30 s                                | shorter = snappier; must be shorter than `RELEASE_DUR` (input faster than spring recovery) |
| RELEASE_DUR          | 0.40–0.90 s                                | shorter = tight pop; longer = loose, wobbly settle                                         |
| BOUNCE_FACTOR        | 1.4 soft · 2.0 firm · 2.8 cartoony         | or `elastic.out(amplitude, period)` for a rubbery oscillation instead of one overshoot     |
| RELEASE_START        | `= PRESS_START + PRESS_DUR`                | adjacency = automatic state continuity                                                     |
| BURST_PEAK_SCALE     | 3 subtle · 6 default · 8 max               | beyond ~8 the radial gradient pixelates visibly                                            |
| BURST_PEAK_OPACITY   | 0.4–1.0                                    | grow ≈ fade, 0.4–0.7 s each; blur 40–100 px (hard ring → ambient haze)                     |
| BG_GLOW_PEAK_OPACITY | 0.1 subtle · 0.25 default · 0.45 max       | higher washes the whole composition; fade-in 0.6–1.0 s; inset −300…−500 px at 1080p        |

Color tokens: pressed surface darker than rest; rest shadow large + diffuse, pressed small + tight (the button "sinks toward the surface"); burst gradient darker + more saturated than `{btnBg}` — same-color glow looks washed out; bg glow a low-opacity tint of the button's hue family.

## Critical Constraints

- **State continuity** — release start value exactly equals press end value; enforced by same-property adjacency at `RELEASE_START = PRESS_START + PRESS_DUR`.
- **Linear press, spring release** — both spring → squishy; both linear → mechanical, no overshoot punch.
- **Anchor compression on center** (`transform-origin: 50% 50%`) or the button collapses asymmetrically.
- **Burst behind, not in front** — burst `z-index: 1`, button `z-index: 2`; in front it occludes the button at peak opacity.
- **Don't tween `boxShadow` and `filter` on the same element** — they compete in the layout pipeline; shadow on the button, blur on the separate burst layer.
- **Climax dwell** — after the burst peak + reveal, the composition must run ≥ 1 s more (≥ 2 s for dramatic variants); a reveal at `t = DURATION − 0.2 s` reads as "flashed and gone."

# SVG Path Draw

Reveals an SVG shape by animating its stroke as if a pen were tracing it. Two stroke properties together: **`stroke-dasharray = <pathLength>`** makes the entire path one dash; **`stroke-dashoffset`** starts at the path length (dash shifted fully out of view → invisible) and tweens to `0` (fully drawn). The length comes from the DOM API `path.getTotalLength()` — measured, never guessed.

Works on anything with a stroke: `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`, `<ellipse>`.

// Setup: measure each path and set its dash pattern. Real measured geometry, not a magic number.
document.querySelectorAll(".logo-mark path").forEach((p) => {
  const len = p.getTotalLength();
  p.style.strokeDasharray = `${len}`;
  p.style.strokeDashoffset = `${len}`;
});

// Stagger draws so the eye reads continuous motion — each segment starts at
// ~70-80% of the previous segment's duration, before it finishes.
tl.to(
  "#bar-left",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-right",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_2_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-mid",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_3_START,

// Companion wordmark fades in only after the last stroke settles.

```

## Variations

- **Ring starting at 12 o'clock** — `<circle>` / `<rect>` strokes start at 3 o'clock by default; rotate the element `-90deg` so a progress ring draws from the top:

```html
<circle
  cx="100"
  cy="100"
  r="60"
  id="ring"
  style="transform-origin: 100px 100px; transform: rotate(-90deg)"
/>
```

- **Linear (constant-speed) draw** — `ease: "none"` for a steady-rate "real pen" trace.
- **Draw then fill** — for filled shapes, tween `fillOpacity: 0 → 1` AFTER the stroke completes (requires `fill-opacity: 0` initially and a real `fill` in CSS):

```js
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { fillOpacity: 1, duration: FILL_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  SEG_1_START + SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR,
);
```

## Values

| token             | range                                   | notes                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR  | 0.3–0.8s                                | fast snap vs deliberate pen trace; >~1s feels sluggish for a logo reveal                           |
| FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR | 60–80% of SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR              | proportional to segment length — a short connector at full duration reads slower than its siblings |
| SEG_N_START       | previous start + 70–80% of its duration | reads as continuous motion, not N isolated animations                                              |
| SEG_1_START       | 0–0.4s                                  | a small ~0.2s lead-in lets the viewer settle before motion                                         |
| BRAND_FADE_START  | ≥ last stroke end (+ ~0.2s beat)        | earlier and the wordmark competes with the draw                                                    |
| BRAND_FADE_DUR    | 0.3–0.8s                                | snap (urgent) vs glide (premium)                                                                   |

Ease families are discrete choices: **stroke draws** use `power2.out` (a hand lifting at end of stroke) or `none` for constant speed — never `back.out` / `elastic.out` (pens don't bounce). **Fades** use `power1.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **`fill: none`** for outline-only draws — otherwise the fill appears immediately.
- **Dasharray/dashoffset = the measured `getTotalLength()`**, set at setup; requires the SVG in the DOM (inline SVG is fine; a loaded `<image>` SVG is not).
- **Complex paths**: if `getTotalLength()` looks wrong, overestimate slightly (`len * 1.05`) — too large is invisible at animation start; too small clips the end.
- **Stagger multi-path draws at ~70–80%** of the previous segment's duration.
- **A drawn line must land on something.** When the path is a connector (rail, beam, underline, callout) rather than a shape, both endpoints must sit on real elements and the draw must do a job — reveal, route, validate, or emphasize. A stroke that only decorates empty space reads as filler; attach it or cut it.
